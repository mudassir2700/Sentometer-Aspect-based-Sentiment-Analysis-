Okay ; if you are reading this , you must be buying this 6s in 2018 onwards.So honestly , this is what I thought when I ordered it 6 months back. I have been through all the reviews and then I was so sure that yes i really should order this and , i am so happy with my choice now.Product review:1. Battery life: I was not sure with this thing when I bought it; but believe me this product I have is better in terms of battery life than my android (coolpad note 3). Can go 2 days with normal usage  on a single go.2. Picture quality: It is so amazing. I have been using it for my YT videos. And I found no problem at all .3. Hang issue: None yet4. Money: I got it for 34k , when it comes to apple; they do charge a lot. But believe me with this they provides lot of good quality as well.And if you are reading this , you sure don’t have money issues.5. Apps: I didn’t pay for a single app untill the day, and forget what other says , apple is amazing .Conclusion:Buy this product for sure, dont worry about model ; 6s is forever. Not too expensive like x series and still have all the features.Hope this will help.Let me know if you need more help..
My headset and charger were duplicates..can someone help me getting the original one.
The good things about the iPhone 6s: Camera is excellent in the daylight, 3D-touch is butter smooth, good sound quality, look wise a perfect piece, battery charges very quickly, and also earphone sound is very good and so many good security and other features which I Ioved in the iPhone.The bad thing is only the battery, which is average (1 day for the average user). Overall a good purchase, go for it in a GIF..
A great product! There are multiple reviews in Amazon and on the web.I did not yet feel any lag to the software; recently updated to iOS12 and it is working great..
Everything is perfect as the name says it all...but one thing which i need is the bill... i need a proper receipt of the bill... whether in pdf or whatever.. pz do send me the same as the receipt which i have got is literally like a fake one...Thank you.
Very good camera quy.
Don't buy in sale ... duplicate product is delivered.
Loving the phone,had trust issues before buying,but now,completely satisfied with the phone,nice camera,battery life not the best,decent one,just go for it,I swear you won’t regret.
I received this product on 29 Nov. I after doing initial setup phone started to head very badly. Even though with normal uses it will heat up. I requested amazon for replacement as the replacement window was open but they told me that they can’t do anything you have to contact apple care. That was really horrible as what is the meaning of replacement period as they claim before you buy the product. That to there was not much help from the apple care as they were telling until you receive a message saying iphone needs to cool down you can use the phone without any issues. It felt funny but what to say here as its was my money that got wasted on this device..
First few months the phone is working properly. After 6 months started getting issues. The phone suddenly stops display and stucked, None of the options worked to on it again. It displays only if some one calls to that number. It is really weird.Amazon should concentrate more on original products.
First thing about iphone 6s and /SE is their being value for money.its the very first iphone/ios experience one can have in reasonable price.iphone/ios experience means seamless performance, speedy response, no legging, multi tasking is awesome, no fear of virus, safest and easy to operate OS.  if u r planning to buy ur very first iphone just remember unlike android,  ios is very resource efficient OS and the amount of RAM doesn’t really matter. whether it is 1gb, 2gb, or 3gb ram . u will get seamless performance in all the cases.the camera is pretty good.the screen is great especially typing on iphone is a gem.the sound is good, grip n feel, form factor is the best possible. front cam is good in day light..
Excellent phone, batty is lower compared to other phones of this ranges.
The mobile is Apte a Nd VFM for the price and if you are not tech savvy guy this is more than what you need. The quality and fit and finish is what you expect from an iPhone and only down side is the battery life which gets worse as you use along the year... but a quick battery replacement from OEM suppliers will solve this..
Within 2 months, the phone suddenly dead while using voice memo & not working now (even after start & resent button long press). I need replacement of this phone. Such a costly phone has very low reliability & My confidence on Apple product is going down after this model usage..
This phone is very good in terms of battery backup and user interface.  a high quality earphone that is also classy..
iPhone box packing best of its kind, as usual.amazon delivery with in 2 days.even in 2018 & 2019 phone is matchable with new android phones.As updates keep in the race.Pro’s :1.CAMERAbest with 12 MP , low light camera is ace feature. No light camera is the poor.Front camera also good.2.speed , gaming at best.What not all are best.3. Battery is okay with internet ON whole dayCon’s :1. Notification light , usually in android phone , septa’s coloured light one can assign to message,wats app, mails,etc in the flash light can be used as a notification light..
Scratch on Screen.... Voice breaks while using Speaker during calls.
Guys be careful..Seems Apple has launched defective phones in 2019. The phone started heating on first day itself and battery was draining ridiculously while using 4G.Even Amazon has poor return policy... seems they are not taking responsibility of Branded phones.. they leave that with you...
Performance is not good. Battery gets drained out very fast and device gets warm..
There is nothing much to tell about an iPhone. Everything is good about that phone.Only con is battery.. Charges very slowly and I feel gets drained very fast..
Amazing PhoneDurableCamera 5* out of 5Battery 4.5*Interface-5*Speed-5*Price 5*Delivery 6*Night Mode, 3D Touch, IOS 12-excellent.
only battery is not upto mark u need to charge it 3ice a day to get full access in terms of heavy usage in normal usage it will gives u whole 10-11 hrs battery backup,in standby mode gives almost a 3days backup,,As i bought for my mom she has only call usage so its gives easily 7-8 hrs backup,,.
I am facing problem with the speaker while talkingVoice from other side get burst in between.
I don’t know but it has hanging issue. Sometimes stuck and needed to restart.
Touch is too bad look like replica.
Over all the product is good thanks for amazon.
Now Apple is doing pure business since the time they lost Steve. No proper customer service and the quality deteriorating day-by-day. They should do something with the battery life seriously.However, Apple products are addiction, you cannot stop using them once you start using them..
Original product good price prompt delivery packaging was awesomeIphone has no comparison to.Ny phoneBest in its classEasy to use ...if using just for basic purposesPicture quality is good as compared to my old iphone 5s...better sound and handling.
Product is good only issue which I have been facing is of battery backup.
No product can match apple device in the market.
Oh God amazon means amazing.  They have right product at right price I am extremely delighted to buy from amazon apple i6 s.  Excellent power packed phone at most reasonable price.
Guys, You cannot compare premium phones with the other brands coz its an iPhone, I gifted this phone to my cousin after using for 2 years still it looks like a better one from the other now I'm using iPhone X but still the OS which is running in X and the same iOS is running in 6s coz thats the beauty about apple product..
The piece I received started hanging and getting switched off all of sudden in six months time and had to restart frequently.  last week it has switched off all of sudden and didn't start. As I am presently in Sindelfingen Germany I took to the nearest apple store. They checked the product and said the motherboard is damaged and I have to get it repaired only in India. Poor and unexpected performance from an Apple product. Seems to be a duplicate product..
The phone has all the necessary features one can expect from an iPhone point of view except the battery back up is not up to the mark but fast charging feature is the saviour in that caseApart from that , it is a great phone.
ProsEverything ok for an ios lover, from real money value to security features, from camera to performance. Everything is top class.ConsFor a android lover u can’t extand ur storage,U can’t download what ever u want for free, in this price ucan get a 64 gb device n much more features then iphone 6s bt Security is a concern in android devicesThats it for now.
Good piece, working well. Good experience from Amazon shopping. My suggestion is, to maintain your standards always..
Here I would like to inform about the product I received from apple. Within 2 weeks I got below issues.1. Camera not opening have to switch off and on.2. When I open message window there is black line on left hand side.3. Speaker doesn’t providing clear sound.Kindly fix these asap and contact me below number: 9871022584.
Amazon delivery was very bad..  And I'm not at all satisfied...
Very poor battery life..
This is the last series of iPhone that comes with a headphone jack. Battery charging is very fast. Love the iMessage anf FaceTime features. If you are thinking of buying an iPhone in 2019 then just go for this 6s. Its fast, better and display screen is really beautiful..
The phone is truly awesome, the only thing that miss here is the low light camera. Seems like the phone is not able to record the low light videos. Otherwise really good phone..
iPhone always best and packaging is good and product is functioning perfect.
Was a bit apprehensive to order... But product delivered  on time.Original product4 months now.... No complains..
Hi All, Yesterday only got this product and i really not happy with this product. i don't like camera quality at all, also phone is working slow. Basically its not as per my expectation so wanted to return.Kindly accept my request and process for return. Please call me if any query..
Genuine Apple Product.
Relatively Slow. As Apple is launching the new versions, older versions are ensured to be performed at OK level. Hanging Issues, car play interphase never works properly..
Apple iPhone Genuine Product.

As compared to current phones this phone camera is not that good. But whatever, An IPhone is an IPhone..
Poor camera, slippy aesthetics , decent RAM performance and excellent call experience.
No face recognition. Fingerprint is top notch.

First few months the phone is working properly. After 6 months started getting issues. The phone suddenly stops display and stucked, None of the options worked to on it again. It displays only if some one calls to that number. It is really weird.Amazon should concentrate more on original products.
Okay ; if you are reading this , you must be buying this 6s in 2018 onwards.So honestly , this is what I thought when I ordered it 6 months back. I have been through all the reviews and then I was so sure that yes i really should order this and , i am so happy with my choice now.Product review:1. Battery life: I was not sure with this thing when I bought it; but believe me this product I have is better in terms of battery life than my android (coolpad note 3). Can go 2 days with normal usage  on a single go.2. Picture quality: It is so amazing. I have been using it for my YT videos. And I found no problem at all .3. Hang issue: None yet4. Money: I got it for 34k , when it comes to apple; they do charge a lot. But believe me with this they provides lot of good quality as well.And if you are reading this , you sure don’t have money issues.5. Apps: I didn’t pay for a single app untill the day, and forget what other says , apple is amazing .Conclusion:Buy this product for sure, dont worry about model ; 6s is forever. Not too expensive like x series and still have all the features.Hope this will help.Let me know if you need more help..
My headset and charger were duplicates..can someone help me getting the original one.
The good things about the iPhone 6s: Camera is excellent in the daylight, 3D-touch is butter smooth, good sound quality, look wise a perfect piece, battery charges very quickly, and also earphone sound is very good and so many good security and other features which I Ioved in the iPhone.The bad thing is only the battery, which is average (1 day for the average user). Overall a good purchase, go for it in a GIF..
A great product! There are multiple reviews in Amazon and on the web.I did not yet feel any lag to the software; recently updated to iOS12 and it is working great..
Everything is perfect as the name says it all...but one thing which i need is the bill... i need a proper receipt of the bill... whether in pdf or whatever.. pz do send me the same as the receipt which i have got is literally like a fake one...Thank you.
Very good camera quy.
Don't buy in sale ... duplicate product is delivered.
Loving the phone,had trust issues before buying,but now,completely satisfied with the phone,nice camera,battery life not the best,decent one,just go for it,I swear you won’t regret.
I received this product on 29 Nov. I after doing initial setup phone started to head very badly. Even though with normal uses it will heat up. I requested amazon for replacement as the replacement window was open but they told me that they can’t do anything you have to contact apple care. That was really horrible as what is the meaning of replacement period as they claim before you buy the product.

First thing about iphone 6s and /SE is their being value for money.its the very first iphone/ios experience one can have in reasonable price.iphone/ios experience means seamless performance, speedy response, no legging, multi tasking is awesome, no fear of virus, safest and easy to operate OS.  if u r planning to buy ur very first iphone just remember unlike android,  ios is very resource efficient OS and the amount of RAM doesn’t really matter. whether it is 1gb, 2gb, or 3gb ram . u will get seamless performance in all the cases.the camera is pretty good.the screen is great especially typing on iphone is a gem.the sound is good, grip n feel, form factor is the best possible. front cam is good in day light..
Excellent phone, batty is lower compared to other phones of this ranges.
The mobile is Apte a Nd VFM for the price and if you are not tech savvy guy this is more than what you need. The quality and fit and finish is what you expect from an iPhone and only down side is the battery life which gets worse as you use along the year... but a quick battery replacement from OEM suppliers will solve this..
Within 2 months, the phone suddenly dead while using voice memo & not working now (even after start & resent button long press). I need replacement of this phone. Such a costly phone has very low reliability & My confidence on Apple product is going down after this model usage..
This phone is very good in terms of battery backup and user interface.  a high quality earphone that is also classy..
iPhone box packing best of its kind, as usual.amazon delivery with in 2 days.even in 2018 & 2019 phone is matchable with new android phones.As updates keep in the race.Pro’s :1.CAMERAbest with 12 MP , low light camera is ace feature. No light camera is the poor.Front camera also good.2.speed , gaming at best.What not all are best.3. Battery is okay with internet ON whole dayCon’s :1. Notification light , usually in android phone , septa’s coloured light one can assign to message,wats app, mails,etc in the flash light can be used as a notification light..
Scratch on Screen.... Voice breaks while using Speaker during calls.
Guys be careful..Seems Apple has launched defective phones in 2019. The phone started heating on first day itself and battery was draining ridiculously while using 4G.Even Amazon has poor return policy... seems they are not taking responsibility of Branded phones.. they leave that with you...
Performance is not good. Battery gets drained out very fast and device gets warm..
There is nothing much to tell about an iPhone. Everything is good about that phone.Only con is battery.. Charges very slowly and I feel gets drained very fast..
Amazing PhoneDurableCamera 5* out of 5Battery 4.5*Interface-5*Speed-5*Price 5*Delivery 6*Night Mode, 3D Touch, IOS 12-excellent.
only battery is not upto mark u need to charge it 3ice a day to get full access in terms of heavy usage in normal usage it will gives u whole 10-11 hrs battery backup,in standby mode gives almost a 3days backup,,As i bought for my mom she has only call usage so its gives easily 7-8 hrs backup,,.
I am facing problem with the speaker while talkingVoice from other side get burst in between.
I don’t know but it has hanging issue. Sometimes stuck and needed to restart.
Touch is too bad look like replica.
Over all the product is good thanks for amazon.
Now Apple is doing pure business since the time they lost Steve. No proper customer service and the quality deteriorating day-by-day. They should do something with the battery life seriously.However, Apple products are addiction, you cannot stop using them once you start using them..
Original product good price prompt delivery packaging was awesomeIphone has no comparison to.Ny phoneBest in its classEasy to use ...if using just for basic purposesPicture quality is good as compared to my old iphone 5s...better sound and handling.
Product is good only issue which I have been facing is of battery backup.
No product can match apple device in the market.
Oh God amazon means amazing.  They have right product at right price I am extremely delighted to buy from amazon apple i6 s.  Excellent power packed phone at most reasonable price.
Guys, You cannot compare premium phones with the other brands coz its an iPhone, I gifted this phone to my cousin after using for 2 years still it looks like a better one from the other now I'm using iPhone X but still the OS which is running in X and the same iOS is running in 6s coz thats the beauty about apple product..
The piece I received started hanging and getting switched off all of sudden in six months time and had to restart frequently.  last week it has switched off all of sudden and didn't start. As I am presently in Sindelfingen Germany I took to the nearest apple store. They checked the product and said the motherboard is damaged and I have to get it repaired only in India. Poor and unexpected performance from an Apple product. Seems to be a duplicate product..
The phone has all the necessary features one can expect from an iPhone point of view except the battery back up is not up to the mark but fast charging feature is the saviour in that caseApart from that , it is a great phone.
ProsEverything ok for an ios lover, from real money value to security features, from camera to performance. Everything is top class.ConsFor a android lover u can’t extand ur storage,U can’t download what ever u want for free, in this price ucan get a 64 gb device n much more features then iphone 6s bt Security is a concern in android devicesThats it for now.
Good piece, working well. Good experience from Amazon shopping. My suggestion is, to maintain your standards always..
Here I would like to inform about the product I received from apple. Within 2 weeks I got below issues.1. Camera not opening have to switch off and on.2. When I open message window there is black line on left hand side.3. Speaker doesn’t providing clear sound.Kindly fix these asap and contact me below number: 9871022584.
Amazon delivery was very bad..  And I'm not at all satisfied...
Very poor battery life..
This is the last series of iPhone that comes with a headphone jack. Battery charging is very fast. Love the iMessage anf FaceTime features. If you are thinking of buying an iPhone in 2019 then just go for this 6s. Its fast, better and display screen is really beautiful..
The phone is truly awesome, the only thing that miss here is the low light camera. Seems like the phone is not able to record the low light videos. Otherwise really good phone..
iPhone always best and packaging is good and product is functioning perfect.
Was a bit apprehensive to order... But product delivered  on time.Original product4 months now.... No complains..
Hi All, Yesterday only got this product and i really not happy with this product. i don't like camera quality at all, also phone is working slow. Basically its not as per my expectation so wanted to return.Kindly accept my request and process for return. Please call me if any query..
Genuine Apple Product.
Relatively Slow. As Apple is launching the new versions, older versions are ensured to be performed at OK level. Hanging Issues, car play interphase never works properly..
Apple iPhone Genuine Product.
This is i-phone 6s,Such a lot of nice phone keep to me very nice picture quality and sound is very loudly.
It’s like one and half year since I bought this iPhone 6s there is no  complaint and it is like I’m using this from day one to till now I can feel the same in performance and everything.
Picture quality is very good.Live photo and slow motion video are cool.Sound is very good of both device and headphone.Works very smoothBattery could have been betterOverall its worth the money.
It’s a really awesome phone.. everything is just awesome about this I phone 6 s.. and great customer service by amazon. I bought this phone es 23000 and now it’s price showing 29900.. bettery is not long lasting  but if you are a normal user than it’s fine.
nice.
As compared to current phones this phone camera is not that good. But whatever, An IPhone is an IPhone..
Poor camera, slippy aesthetics , decent RAM performance and excellent call experience.
No face recognition. Fingerprint is top notch.
Good in this value.
So the thing is, my iPhone cable is being stitched out and the wiring is coming out from the cable.
Build quality is wonderfulPicture quality is awesomeSound quality is very goodBattery is averagedisplay is awesome and perfectand on time delivery by amazon..

Okay ; if you are reading this , you must be buying this 6s in 2018 onwards.So honestly , this is what I thought when I ordered it 6 months back. I have been through all the reviews and then I was so sure that yes i really should order this and , i am so happy with my choice now.Product review:1. Battery life: I was not sure with this thing when I bought it; but believe me this product I have is better in terms of battery life than my android (coolpad note 3). Can go 2 days with normal usage  on a single go.2. Picture quality: It is so amazing. I have been using it for my YT videos. And I found no problem at all .3. Hang issue: None yet4. Money: I got it for 34k , when it comes to apple; they do charge a lot. But believe me with this they provides lot of good quality as well.And if you are reading this , you sure don’t have money issues.5. Apps: I didn’t pay for a single app untill the day, and forget what other says , apple is amazing .Conclusion:Buy this product for sure, dont worry about model ; 6s is forever. Not too expensive like x series and still have all the features.Hope this will help.Let me know if you need more help..
My headset and charger were duplicates..can someone help me getting the original one.
The good things about the iPhone 6s: Camera is excellent in the daylight, 3D-touch is butter smooth, good sound quality, look wise a perfect piece, battery charges very quickly, and also earphone sound is very good and so many good security and other features which I Ioved in the iPhone.The bad thing is only the battery, which is average (1 day for the average user). Overall a good purchase, go for it in a GIF..
A great product! There are multiple reviews in Amazon and on the web.I did not yet feel any lag to the software; recently updated to iOS12 and it is working great..
Everything is perfect as the name says it all...but one thing which i need is the bill... i need a proper receipt of the bill... whether in pdf or whatever.. pz do send me the same as the receipt which i have got is literally like a fake one...Thank you.
Very good camera quy.
Don't buy in sale ... duplicate product is delivered.
Loving the phone,had trust issues before buying,but now,completely satisfied with the phone,nice camera,battery life not the best,decent one,just go for it,I swear you won’t regret.
I received this product on 29 Nov. I after doing initial setup phone started to head very badly. Even though with normal uses it will heat up. I requested amazon for replacement as the replacement window was open but they told me that they can’t do anything you have to contact apple care. That was really horrible as what is the meaning of replacement period as they claim before you buy the product. That to there was not much help from the apple care as they were telling until you receive a message saying iphone needs to cool down you can use the phone without any issues. It felt funny but what to say here as its was my money that got wasted on this device..
First few months the phone is working properly. After 6 months started getting issues. The phone suddenly stops display and stucked, None of the options worked to on it again. It displays only if some one calls to that number. It is really weird.Amazon should concentrate more on original products.

That was really horrible as what is the meaning of replacement period as they claim before you buy the product. That to there was not much help from the apple care as they were telling until you receive a message saying iphone needs to cool down you can use the phone without any issues. It felt funny but what to say here as its was my money that got wasted on this device..
First few months the phone is working properly. After 6 months started getting issues. The phone suddenly stops display and stucked, None of the options worked to on it again. It displays only if some one calls to that number. It is really weird.Amazon should concentrate more on original products.
Okay ; if you are reading this , you must be buying this 6s in 2018 onwards.So honestly , this is what I thought when I ordered it 6 months back. I have been through all the reviews and then I was so sure that yes i really should order this and , i am so happy with my choice now.Product review:1. Battery life: I was not sure with this thing when I bought it; but believe me this product I have is better in terms of battery life than my android (coolpad note 3). Can go 2 days with normal usage  on a single go.2. Picture quality: It is so amazing. I have been using it for my YT videos. And I found no problem at all .3. Hang issue: None yet4. Money: I got it for 34k , when it comes to apple; they do charge a lot. But believe me with this they provides lot of good quality as well.And if you are reading this , you sure don’t have money issues.5. Apps: I didn’t pay for a single app untill the day, and forget what other says , apple is amazing .Conclusion:Buy this product for sure, dont worry about model ; 6s is forever. Not too expensive like x series and still have all the features.Hope this will help.Let me know if you need more help..
My headset and charger were duplicates..can someone help me getting the original one.
The good things about the iPhone 6s: Camera is excellent in the daylight, 3D-touch is butter smooth, good sound quality, look wise a perfect piece, battery charges very quickly, and also earphone sound is very good and so many good security and other features which I Ioved in the iPhone.The bad thing is only the battery, which is average (1 day for the average user). Overall a good purchase, go for it in a GIF..
A great product! There are multiple reviews in Amazon and on the web.I did not yet feel any lag to the software; recently updated to iOS12 and it is working great..
Everything is perfect as the name says it all...but one thing which i need is the bill... i need a proper receipt of the bill... whether in pdf or whatever.. pz do send me the same as the receipt which i have got is literally like a fake one...Thank you.
Very good camera quy.
Don't buy in sale ... duplicate product is delivered.
Loving the phone,had trust issues before buying,but now,completely satisfied with the phone,nice camera,battery life not the best,decent one,just go for it,I swear you won’t regret.

I got this phone on Friday evening.Pros:Great battery lifeAmazing performancePremium designImpressive rear and front cameraIn display fingerprint scanner is really fastCons:No headphone jack but you'll get a converterNo notification LEDNo microSD card slotI will give points on my personal experience of 2 days full usage as below:Weight: 9/10OS: 10/10Screen size: 10/10CPU: 10/10Performance: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (you'll get approx 113 gb for use)Battery: 8/10Rear camera: 10/10Front camera: 10/10In display fingerprint scanner: 9/10Face unlock: 10/10I hope this will help full..
Camera quality is not upto the mark. I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems..
1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.3. Camera quality is very poor.4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product..
I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore..
One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements..
I ordered one plus 6t phone today I got delivered wen I opened found that ear phones missing in the boxes plz let me clear the issue.
Only one side of speakers is working. Right side is not working.
Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phone.
OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon..
Good build.amazing battery life. ( Minimum 3 days stand by along with basic use in airtel's 4g network)good accessories on op site.cool phone box packing.in display fingerprint sensor & face recognition both are good.loudspeaker is decent. has a c type to 3.5mm adapter in the box.value for money. Go for it!.
After replace the handset issue was resolved. Now i unlocked the speed i need..
Two days back I received 6T and had many problems with the mobileThe mobile is getting heated when it's on camera mode or doing nothing., and while using mobile it's getting struck.. I don't think I got an original set, I'm sure it's a duplicate set.Please for god sake please exchange my mobile with a new one.
Got delivered in just 2.5 hours of my order. No bad overservations yet. Fingerprint unlock is also good, if you have face unlock ON then all the time it will unlock with face data before the the fingerprint works..
This has by far been the best phone I have ever used hands-on. Flagship Specs, Classy look, Premium Packaging and the Speed you Need!Appearance - The device looks very much similar to the OnePlus 6T upfront but it has got the speed orange highlights at the back, carbon finish and McLaren Branding at the bottom.Camera - The night mode really captures amazing pictures and the portrait mode is just amazing. The low light photography could still be improved.Battery - With average usage with full day data on, it easily lasts upto 2 days. The Warp charging is just amazing, it takes around 40-45 mins to charge from 0-100%. But you could easily get a day's charge within 20 mins.Speed - With 10 Gigs of RAM, speed should not be a question. You could open up 5 high specs games and it still wouldn't lag. And its bragging rights for sure!Overall, I am really satisfied with this device and feels great to be a part of OnePlus Community! Go, get it! Its for those, who are in continuous pursuit for speed!.
Amazing phone, just feels good.Done the ma+h, price isn't everything.You get what you pay for. :)Excellent battery,Great screen,Amazing performance,Smoooth OS,Great camera,Surprisingly decent audio,Cool screen unlock and ridiculously fast face unlock.The phone is worth every penny spent..
The device is very bad. Camera quality is very poor. Please don't buy it guys go for Apple iPhone XS instead. Apple has a far better Camera.No Color options in 256gb variant. OnePlus should learn from Apple they have a lot of Color options at the time of launch. OnePlus is not worth the price..
Camera pics are not having good quality. Pixel is not clear.
The in-display fingerprint sensor is very bad. It is slow and many times it takes multiple attempts to scan the finger. This phone is big disappointment. I would not recommend this phone at all.They didn't give headphone jack which is okay as they were giving free bullets V2 for those who pre-booked the phone. But they should atleast have given IP rating as IP gives peace of mind and stereo speaker should have been there instead of dummy holes at bottom. Needless to say that Oneplus phones have good software and this one is no exception. This has good software which is fast and fluid. My point is that don't buy this phone for fingerprint sensor. If you are having other OnePlus phone then you should hold for next OnePlus phone..
Battery-Extremely PoorCamera-SatisfactoryLook-GoodWeight-GoodSound-SuperbOverall I would have given it half star,deeply through by it's battery.And even after the replacement,the same problem persists,which means it's a clear cut case of faulty manufacturing.Please don't buy it,if you really love your hard earned money......
Issue with the Camera Slow Motion Mode is Not Working in Home Black Shade is Moving from left to right Sound Quality is not that good.
They are telling it comes. With strongest back glass, on the first day itself, for a drop from 4 feet hieght my phone got a new back shattered glass.
Very nice and fantastic phn, the best smart phn till date, awesome camera good battery life.
Used it for close to 45 days now, overall a very good phone but for this price point i would expect much better camera. Since Asus Zenfone 5Z also gives similar performance at almost less than 10K. Camera in night mode needs more improvement and does not capture the picture properly .. may be i need to do some tweeks in settings i am not sure. Please see the image i uploaded the fire is tarnished with grey .. same picture without night mode is much better. This is my first 1+ phone .. satisfied but because of camera giving 4 stars..
OnePlus 6T ProsBigger display with water drop notch design look beautiful and AMOLED panel also very good.OnePlus 6T has upgraded 370mAh battery which is 400mAh bigger then OnePlus 6. It also comes with Dash charger one of the fastest smartphone chargers.The base variant comes with 6GB RAM 128GB of storage and price are same as OnePlus 6 6GB RAM 128GB storage variant.The main highlight it has the in-display fingerprint sensor and this is one of the fastest in-display fingerprint sensors.OnePlus known for their stock like Oxygen OS and this time the OnePlus 6T comes with Android 9 pie.New Camera mode like Nightscape and some other photography features are really good.OnePlus 6T ConsThe Oneplus company known to listen to their consumer’s voice, but this time There is no 3.5mm audio jack.The main cons of all OnePlus devices are lacs on microSD card support, yes it does not have any microSD card slot.There is no IP rating for waterproof and dustproof.OnePlus 6T does not have dual speakers like it should because other brands are now offering dual speaker setup.This time OnePlus also use glass at the back but it does not support wireless charging. Now, these days every flagship smartphone has wireless charging support.Frankly speaking the OnePlus 6 still a good device there is no major improvement on OnePlus 6T. If you are a OnePlus fan and wants to buy a new smartphone then you can buy this. But if you already have the OnePlus 6 then don’t waste your money because OnePlus 6 will get all the software feature via OTA updates....
mobile is very good and fast.but battery is draining like anythg..within two days of usage i found battery consumption is more than my old phone redmi note4.
I like its full display and picture quality is good but temperd glass should be given to all customers.
1. Google Play does not work properly, apps are downloading after 3-4 attempts.2. Very Heavy and does not fit well in hands3. Very poor quality of preapplied screen guard. Bubbles came only after 30 minutes of usage4. Camera is very ordinary.
Crisp picture quality, impactful sound and an impressive battery life makes it a worthy investment. A blind buy for those who plan to upgrade to OnePlus from others...Fingerprint sensor, face unlock are exciting features but not indispensible.All in all its a fair deal if the base variant itself is 128gb!! What more can u ask for!!I'm happy...N yes...Thank you Amazon for the On time delivery...
Bought the costliest one. 8gb 256gb model.Received a phone with flickering screen, screen shows different colors every now and then... Battery drains fast and phone heats up even on normal usage. I have used OP3t for 2 years and never faced any problem. But This one didnt stay even for 2 days and I had to request for replacement. 1 day passed and no help, finally anazon says replacement not possible, only refund possible. I hope at least the refund process goes smooth..
OnePlus you make great phones! I have bought and used every phone since OnePlus X !But it's kinda stupid to remove the headphone jack !And what did we get in return a slow fingerprint reader ?No IP rated Water resistance ? No wireless charging?Everyone's loves new features, but not at the cost of essential ones !.
Brightness is very low. I was using OnePlus 5. 20% of brightness in OnePlus 5 is equal to 65% brightness in 6T which may cause  in draining the battery. Not happy with it. Also unlocking with fingerprint is not up to the mark. Totally not so happy with it. Thinking to return it and use OnePlus 5 only.
First and foremost...I really dont miss those 3.5 mm jack. Using bluetooth earpiece and the sound quality is top notch.Picture quality - initial shots taken are impressive.Battery life is best among all one plus phones.Build quality is superb. No issues with call clarity and now the best part...Oxygen OS. Its buttery smooth, fluidic and unputdownable. You will ne addicted to it.Only con is the weight of the device..
Phone is getting hanged and face unlock is not working. I received a phone on 8th November and logged a call with amazon on 9th november that my phone is getting hanged frequently and face unlock is not working properly. They have scheduled the technician visit on 11th November, however, technician not visited. I called amazon related technician, executive told me that technician not visited due to some personal reasons. They don't bother to inform customer if technician are not going to visit.Worst experience faced ever.Don't buy anything from Amazon.I have requested for replacement,but they're denying for replacement..
If yuh are a Iphone user please stay away.,Yu’ll definetely nt like it.
Picture quality is good. Battery life is decent. Sound quality is okay. It's not a beast in any regards considering it's price and the flagship killer tag. You may miss the notification led and the 3.5 mm audio jack. The in screen fingerprint reader is a cool feature but surely feels that first gen not so smooth feature. It just gives you the feeling of not buying a finished product but a work in progress kind of a thing. Not many things to complaint about since it does give you good specifications for a decent price but.. it's no longer a flagship killer to stay. One plus may very well be the new apple. I'd hate to see that happen, but they're in the business for profit afterall. It can't always all be about the community. But I see them get run over by budget phones if their competition could maintain quality.
Impressive at this price point. Only disappointment is  absence 3.5 mm headphone jack. Had Oneplus supplied bullets headphone as default accessory, it would have been a complete package. Apple, learn from it, else your days are numbered..
Pros: Hardware supports good speed and camera.Cons: Screen unlock doesn't work most of the time. Fingerprint is not upto mark and takes a few tries. Also Google smart Lock is not working. There was a defect on the screen protector applied and Amazon says that they product will not be replaced and they cannot do anything about it. Oneplus says buy a new tempered glass and put it!! Fingerprint sensor is hardly able to cope with the normal plastic protector. I don't know how will it work with a thick one. This was the first time I had problem with a product from Amazon and they showed their true colors. Sameer goes for OnePlus..
I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.Phone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.I feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.Go for it if you don't want to compromise !!.
Everything is good about the phone except some software bugs like gestures dnt work flawlessly and i have issue with paint coming out from the top part of the phone near the ear piece.
Phone is not working after update.I need immediate replacement or need my money back without further delay..
Don't buy this Mobile worst network connectivity also no support any service centres, in Maharashtra only 4 services centre unfortunately at my location 300 km from me I was so sad call centre suggest me you visit to service centre to resolve issues .....very slow browsing like 2G phones ...... camera is good but without connecting network it's like only photographer camera....
I received the order @ time thanks to Amazon for delivered @ right time now coming about the phone experience as of all you know why ppl like oneplus is all because of their user interface Yea the oxygen OS it feels buttery smooth with no lag and 0 bloatware it's clean and faster than stock android.,performance is awesome no doubt on that., but display isn't upto the mark like I won't be comparing it to the Samsung displays but to their own previous generation phone., I own a oneplus 3t already been using it fa last 2 years that phone display feels more premium and vibrant than one on the oneplus 6t like 10% brightness on the oneplus 3t is equal to 40% brightness on oneplus 6t but still this display is good and another con is the headphone jack they keep trolling iPhone fa removing the headphone jack last year and used headphone jack as key marketing fa selling their phones @ US and other countries but now no headphone jack that's really ridiculous., it's okay to use the USB c to headphone connector to use while @ home but not comfortable while you do gaming or when you have your phone @ pocket during traveling like you gotta spend some 2k to 4k fa wireless., build quality is good of course it feels premium., especially the one I have Thunder purple it feels more premium., battery life is awesome it lasted about 14 hours with on screen time about 9 hours ( been playing pubg about an hour, YouTube,chatting and browsing, 4g has been on almost all these time) and yea you ll miss that led notification light and they did some compromise with built quality like the earpiece grill and sim tray looks and feels cheap material more like plastic., no stereo speakers but two sound grills and yea it kills all other phones @ performance that includes Samsung note 9 @ this price ( half the price) if you into performance go fa this phone., thermal heat management is good..
Super nice.
Great for all specs except for the battery life. Battery drains faster than expected. Without that totally worth it....
One plus 6 is better than 6t.
The most COMPLETE and HONEST review :-This phone is OUTSTANDING! Mostly in a really good sense, ALTHOUGH somewhere we HAVE TO SETTLE.CONS (Ranked) -1. NO STEREO SPEAKERS , although single mono speaker is good.2. HEADPHONE AUDIO OUTPUT (c type / 3.5 mm / whatever) is ABOVE AVERAGE, but should have been better with greater bass and more fuller ambient sound like LG G7 ThinQ etc. I'll update my review about the Cirrus Logic DAC and Oneplus C type Bullets later.3. Camera depends upon good lighting conditions. TOO MUCH CROP IN FRONT CAMERA VIDEO DUE TO EIS. BLUR IN NIGHTSCAPE, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S MOVEMENT IN FRAME. Wide angle camera should have been a must.4. Fingerprint scanner is like 90% hit and 10% miss. For 97% hit and 3% miss, INPUT SAME FINGER TWICE OR THRICE. PROPER PLACEMENT OF FINGER ON SCANNER is IMPORTANT. However it's SUFFICIENTLY FAST. Placement should have been upper on the screen.5. NO NOTIFICATION LED. SCREEN OFF GESTURES (like O for camera) are HITS AND MISSES OCCASIONALLY.P. S. NO HEADPHONE JACK, NO QHD RESOLUTION and NO WIRELESS CHARGING are NOT CONS, atleast for me.PROS (Ranked) -1. The very BEST SOFTWARE, UI, PERFORMANCE. (CLEAN, FAST AND SMOOTH). MANY CUSTOMISATIONS. BETTER THAN STOCK ANDROID.2. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN like in display fingerprint scanner, cute waterdrop notch etc.3. PREMIUM AND DURABLE BUILD QUALITY. UNOFFICIALLY WATERPROOF.4. GREAT BATTERY life AND DASH CHARGING.5. Great screen.6. Camera can compete with PIXEL 3.7. GREAT VALUE for the price. However, COULD BE of GREATER VALUE. COMPETITION - LG G7 ThinQ, Asus Zenfone 5Z, iPhone 6S plus, etc.P. S. You'll read many PROS in official reviews in the internet, YouTube etc..All in all, the phone and the brand DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION.4.5 OUT OF 5 - ABHISHEK CHAKRAVORTY.
I just got the new one plus 6t. But not received all other accessories with it. Only received one charger , one protective case that s it. Type C to audio adapter is missing..
Very disappointed with slow mo camera quality. I wish I could return the phone..
Worst product i ordered on 1st november 2018 at 00.01 hours i got the product but only ised 1 day and now the phone is not charging and the phone is dead.Dint expect such a baaaaaaddd  product.I always used one plus but from now onwardd no one plus.
I just unlocked the speed today but it disappointed me I can't download apps it takes forever to download for a brand which promotes that it is very fast really disappointed.the battery also drains really fast really disappointed with the phone .I don't recommend this phone at all it also force close few apps after normal use of apps.
battery drain issue.
I got this phone with a minor scratches on the pre installed screen protector, however I'm not sure if those are on the protector or the screen itself. I couldnt file a complain since I am travelling constantly. Will obviously reach out you guys once I'm getting back home..
Please don't buy..gets heated, doesn't startCustomer care has no interest pls don't buy 6t worst one plus product.
The whole product is good but 36k is more for it.
It is not worth for the money. Low light camera performance still low. 25K poco does equal to 6T. In display finger print is laggy. You definitely won't like it. Good battery life.Average display. Performance is good..
Build quality is good. Phone is looking handsome. Two things bothering me. one is notification light. There is no notification light on top of screen so I need to awake my phone everytime to check any message or so. Second thing is fingerprint sensor. It is very sensible I must say unlike the back one. I need to put my finger in proper way otherwise I won't be able to unlock my phone..
The phone got stuck while using one of camera features. Its not even getting restarted. The screen is freezed thus, not allowing to proceed further. Hope i get a replacement soon..
1.Takes too long to charge...took 80minutes to charge from 10%-96%.2.Battery life went down from 100%to 10% in less than 20hours without much usage.3.Fingerprint sensor not very receptive..
1. Picture quality zero third class2. Heat while charging3 heat issue while playing game like pubg4. Slipry grip5. Heavy weight6. Camera in night also wrost7. When you zoom picture taken by 6t shows the blur images and red eyes8. There lack of A. I  artificial intelligence9. Face lock security is totaly unsafe i tried open with my passport size foto & opend screen lock10. Battery life is good fast charging but heating issue also11. No headfone jack you have to manage with charging jack adapter of headfoneI return after using 2 days & thanks to amazone to refund on time and saves my money by return /  refund policy.
I have not received headphones as promised by pre book OnePlus 6t.
Speaker is not working, not happy with the product. I have placed request for replacement but haven't received any confirmation from Amazon yet. Very disappointed..
If you are a op5,op5t or op6 user it is not worth upgradingcons of oneplus 6t:1 the indisplay fingerprint is way too slow and does not work always2 the phone still has some network connectivity issues(s/w upgrades may fix them)3 phone works fast BUT expensive for the price and lacks good features like IR blaster,gloves mode, only limited gestures4 it seems interesting for a week, later its just a normal budget phone5 the low light photos in 'nightscape' is still bad,overall camera is just OK(not as hyped )Pros:1 Phone feels more premium than Rs.25,000 phones but still does not provide the vibe of apple or samsung(note & S series)2 has good customer care support (especially online)3  the software(oxygen OS) is really smooth,no lags at allfor those looking for phones for at least 2-3 years of usage,if possible wait for oneplus 7hope to see a triple rear camera and 5G on oneplus7.
Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade. So I liked many things about this phone. Amazing display. I'm not a notch fan but this is the cutest notch I've seen. Absence of 3.5mm jack might be a let down for many fans including me and I still don't agree with their decision. There is no LED notifications also.Performance wise there's no need of even comparing because this is the best (SD845+OxygenOS+8GB RAM = TRUE WONDER).Didn't get a chance to test the camera much, so no comments on the camera.Some might face problems with fingerprint scanner but register them properly and you would not get any problems. I had none till now.I didn't think that the case in the box would be so good. It's very nice and I've seen phone dropping from 10ft not breaking with this case.Many intrusive ads are comparing this with Pocophone F1. I just laugh at them. OnePlus has a way more premium feel than Pocophone..
Best phone !!!In love with the fingerprint scanner and it's animation !Battery lasts one day !Industry leading camera with studio mode works fantastic !Catchy display !Fast like a flash !Great Value for money !!!!!.
Received faulty piece of mobile, battery can't even last for 6 hours, I am going to return it.
very poor product from one plus and neither amazon is replacing the device battery didn't last long much not even 5 or 6 hours the device is malfunctioning like opening apps on it's own and volume is increasing or decreasing on it's ownnot satisfied with the product.
There are two speakers in One Plus 6T, One speaker is not working.
DESIGN:If you thinking that OnePlus 6 and 6T has no major difference than you are absolutely wrong and highly mistaken if you thing 6 is better than 6T. Price hike is completely justified.Visible differences between 6 & 6T:Higher screen to body ratio, Gorilla Glass 6, in-display fingerprint scanner, taller, water-drop notch. 3700mAh battery.Technical advancement:Advance AI which smartly uses your RAM and ROM which actually boosts the performance, Better heat-sink than 6.CAMERA:I took my canon 1300D with two lens; portrait and 18-55 and OnePlus6T for comparison test. OnePlus 6T provided better results when both on Auto-mode. It has amazing contrast, perfect saturation; but the thing where it stood-out from others its it night picture quality. It does wonders even if there is almost no light and that is some magic over there. Front camera absolutely stunning and comes with screen flash for low light selfies.BATTERY:Battery charging- 0 to 65% in 30 mins and at 45 min it reaches 86%. Full charge by 1hr8 mins when internet, Bluetooth and wifi off. On heavy use it survives 8 hrs (I watched 2 movies in HD with 50% screen brightness and 1 hour PubG gaming on HD, 1 hour YouTubing). On average usage, 17 hours very smoothly(casual social media surfing, browsing, camera usage about 5 to 6 pictures using flash). Without internet usage at all and battery saver on, it can go whooping 3 DAYS !SPEAKERS:External speakers are loud, I mean really very loud. Hearing speaker is very cool by its looks and loud too. Volume rockers and power switch is perfectly hard.SECURITY:Though I feel face detection is worst type of security because it has many drawbacks, its quick. And finger print scanner is also faster than its competitors. The part which irritates is that while using at night in dark, for face and fingerprint detection, the display gets 100% to scan which is very annoying and very uneasy for eyes..
I am a big fan of Apple. Have been using Iphone from last 5 years. Wanted to change the phone to the new one. But not much of Innovation from Apple. So, I switched to Oneplus and Oneplus 6T was a best replacement.The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.Design: Just gorgeous - the curve of the camera bump is more of a design accent than a notch. The phone has a huge 6.41 in screen, but is still easily managed with one hand. The color is amazing - Mirror Black. The 6T feels like it was meant to fit in my hand. The first party OnePlus cases accent the amazing design and make it even more comfortable. When you hold the phone, you will know exactly what I mean!Battery: Lasts more than a day with heavy use. I can get almost 6 hrs of screen on time even after watching YouTube, gaming, and general usage. Even better, the included dash charger fills the battery extremely quickly. No wireless charging, but I don't even miss it.Camera: Solid - 4K 60FPS video looks great. Other phones in this price range can't even touch the quality of the camera for pictures. Night shot is solid, looking forward to Future tweeks to prevent the blown out appearance when some light is present.Sound: Probably the only change I would make. The since downward firing speaker is easy to block. The quality is great - would love to see the dual speaker in the next OnePlus phone.While you could say that OnePlus has made some sacrifices in developing the OnePlus 6T, they all seem rather subjective. Sure it’s a slightly bigger, thicker, heavier phone than the 6 but if that means a bigger battery with better longevity is it really a loss?The headphone jack’s absence is annoying for some but the phone comes with an adapter and the in-display fingerprint sensor might not have fit in the same footprint otherwise..
Super.
Damaged.
Phone functions are nice. Battery performance is not lasting good. Battery is dying very rapidly. I am changing full charge twice in 24hrs still battery is getting down to 19%. Most funny part is that I am hardly using my phone. This is very depressing after paying such a big amount (hard earned money) of Rs. 38000/- and battery performance is so much poor.Spoken to the Amazon technical support for this. They have done some online test through some app and get to know that something is wrong with this phone battery and told me for the "BRAND NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE" on Monday 5th November 2018. I have received my phone on 2nd Nov and spoken to Amazon technical support engineer on 3rd Nov. Although I haven't received any email / SMS from Amazon yet. I can trust them on there words and will receive brand NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE on 5th November itself..
I purchased one plus 6t on nov 1st and gor it delivered on nov 3rd. Everything is fine but touch is not functioning properly at the corners of diaplay. Didn't expect such issue with onw plus.
Hello Guys,I am using this phone past 2 days over all phone is good its worth to buy. But there are some issues which i am mentioning below.1-  battery is not so good, its draning fast not so fast but ya fast.2- there is no am -pm in clock which very basic function in every damn phone.3- you can face internet problem may be your sim doesn't support the handset. But there is issue.4- performance what i was expecting is not top notch what company claiming. You can get same kind of speed  in 20k phone easily.5- lastly the finger scanning lock is not so fast, sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts.Guys this is my geniune report about this phone. I m very much fan of oneplus family. But 2 times i took wrong decisions 1- for oneplus 5 it was a worst phone and2- OnePlus 6t actually its not a worst phone but i was expecting a top notch speed. But OnePlus 6t not match that level.If you have budget to buy and you want it anyhow than you can go for it.... Otherwise there are lots of better options. Available in market in 20k which match almost same quality & look. So don't waste your money if you don't have much in your pocket. Don't push your self to buy this phone.I am give this phone 3 star just bcz its not that bad but its not that good. Now choices upto you..
Adding another call, when a call is already in progress is night mare. Either app crashes or it doesnt allow. During phone call disabling blue tooth is not posisble. I see lot of UI issues. God only why people were so hyped about this phone. its not doing what 7000rs Samsung phone does. Please don't buy this phone and waste your money..
I got a defective product.
Things are not the same as promoted, I bought this on 2nd Nov, look wise its good, sound is also loud, its just loud nothin else, battery has just improved marginally if you keep your location on and play some game or video, it will be low very soon. Ofcourse at the end it will hang little longer but not as expected. Display Hangs!! Yes!!! this phone hangs even with 8gb RAM, have faced it few times even in first 10 days. Worst part is the front screen lock is too too slow, even i have to use pin code most of the time. Overall the phone launch was just a hype but the performance is not upto the expectation!!!.
38000 price not good.
Very baf.
I am using oneplus 6t phone from 1st of November and I am facing issue with camera when I m using camera with flash then image taking blur and in yellow colour this issue I am facing after updating oneplus 6t phoneDon't not true on camera.
Add/ enable proper always on display.. without LED notification light we can't see notification.. really not satisfied disabled always on display/Ambiant display....
As the slogan says never settle....proper flagship killer.
Battery life is better. Picture quality is good. Sound quality is also reasonably good but definitely not the best among its competitors. Having said that, this phone is really really fast. Display is awesome. Dash charger is wow as usual..
Annoyed by Amazon,i got a defective OnePlus 6t and Amazon is replacing it, and giving me excuse about seller. Its a suicide purchase for me.on screen fingerprint sensor is not working in my OnePlus 6t..and while setting fingerprint sensor it get swithed off with a loud beep sound..its kind of scary for me..pls help me guys what to do..i belong from small town..i hardly earn 20000. And i bought OnePlus 6t on a friend recommendation..i hv already sold my old phone.this is the only phone i am left with..and its a defective one..i bought it a the time of diwali when i got my salary in advance.. now my salary will come in last week of December.. i have been calling Amazon customer care from the day i purchased it and still no solutions.. feeling low..i hv given all my hard earned money buying this..dont know what to do..pls guide me.. Amazon pls help me..i m begging you..
I like this product very much.
Purchased with great excitement but disappointed the day i got this phone.. Being a flagship killer, i never expected this phone to face heat issues even with a normal usage..the same problem didn't arise with my brother's phone which he took on the same day... Apps didn't download but some how solved that issue later.. And now some apps are force closing and not working.. Remaining features live upto the mark. But being a oneplus fan, my expectations were sky-high about the 6t..slightly disappointed but not a big deal.. Can adjust with this..
Picture quality worst.
Worst service from amazon.never expected this.lost believe in this.they delivered defective piece and not providing the replacement for this.Horrible ecperience.
Overall: 8/10:A fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)Unboxing & contents: 8/10One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.First Impressions: 9/10The device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.Setup: 8/10The SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.Battery: 7/10The unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.Performance: 9/10Gaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering.  Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren  made short work of it.Display: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera.  Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.Camera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.Hope this helps!.

I got this phone on Friday evening.Pros:Great battery lifeAmazing performancePremium designImpressive rear and front cameraIn display fingerprint scanner is really fastCons:No headphone jack but you'll get a converterNo notification LEDNo microSD card slotI will give points on my personal experience of 2 days full usage as below:Weight: 9/10OS: 10/10Screen size: 10/10CPU: 10/10Performance: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (you'll get approx 113 gb for use)Battery: 8/10Rear camera: 10/10Front camera: 10/10In display fingerprint scanner: 9/10Face unlock: 10/10I hope this will help full..
Camera quality is not upto the mark. I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems..
1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.3. Camera quality is very poor.4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product..
I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore..
One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements..
I ordered one plus 6t phone today I got delivered wen I opened found that ear phones missing in the boxes plz let me clear the issue.
Only one side of speakers is working. Right side is not working.
Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phone.
OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon..
Good build.amazing battery life. ( Minimum 3 days stand by along with basic use in airtel's 4g network)good accessories on op site.cool phone box packing.in display fingerprint sensor & face recognition both are good.loudspeaker is decent. has a c type to 3.5mm adapter in the box.value for money. Go for it!.

1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.3. Camera quality is very poor.4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product..
I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore..
One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements..
I ordered one plus 6t phone today I got delivered wen I opened found that ear phones missing in the boxes plz let me clear the issue.
Only one side of speakers is working. Right side is not working.
Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phone.
OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon..

NOTE:@ This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month.@ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone.This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money.BUILT QUALITY :--------------------# iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible  to easy damages.# iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR.# Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed.# To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice.DISPLAY :-----------# iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7") and XR the biggest(6.1"), with X and XS with same size(5.8"), so is the screen to body ratio.# Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P# According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :-----------------------------# I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8.# If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily.# I found X to be better value for money in this segment.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :------------------------------# All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging.# XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time.*XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours.# With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours.# Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance.CAMERA :-----------# In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera.* Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent.# XS sometimes does better over X, but not always.# Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly.# Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion.PRICE (64GB) :---------------8 - Rs.55KX - Rs.75KXR - Rs.77kXS - Rs.99K# Here certainly 8 is winner :PP.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy.VERDICT :-----------After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice.If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS.To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter.If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade.Hope this review helps..
Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees..
Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon.
It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I’m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase..
Aapse nivedan hai ki aap order conformetion mail karte hai or ya dispach informention mail karte hai, tab usme phone ki sari detail matlab IEMI no etc.. bi bheje.. taki hum service center ko dikha sake..I Want invoice .. given IMEI no on invoice not clear .. i have no proof...
The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.I would like to exchange the product with I phone xs, if possible.Kindly help. Regards & thank you..
Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon.
This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down..
Don’t buy this phone only waste of money it hang’s many time..
Extremely easy to use. Good specifications..
Most Beautiful, Fast and Stylish iPhone, I've ever Had...
Single SIM is working fine but if you are using E-sim in this phone. Not good quality for dual sim. Many times Number showing switched off..
A Perfect Phone with a great camera, great performance, Great look, Great Battery life and a good Display. Worth the trade off. Perfect size.
Great Phone, I am happy with the phone so far.Four things I have noticed which make difference in XS and XR .1) 3D touch-  I don't feel it makes a lot of difference.2) OLED Screen which is in XS and XR have LCD screen. - You may see a negligible difference between screen of both phone.3 ) Picture Quality - Due to OLED screen picture quality of the XS is better than XR. You may notice this if OLED screen and XR screen.4) Dual Camera - Blur background picture can be taken through Dual Camera, which is missing in XR.As a iphone lover, I have purchase XR and don't want to shed another 27K for above four features so havent purchased XS.This phone was not available in stores in Noida and Delhi but amazon deliver it in 2 days.Kudos to Amazon for timely delivery..
Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. It’s heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Don’t watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy. Yes it’s expensive. Sometimes rather many times money is not worth than happiness..
Super fast performance, long battery hours, little heavier than iphone 7 plus. Overall good phone..
It is heavy weight if u use more ull feel it hard to hold on regular note!As compared to every flagship phone in market.
ALL good.
Good phone.
It is not supporting any type of sim.. the network gets disconnected after sometime only.
When compared with XS only visible difference would be screen, that too when kept aide by side.Personally preferred this over XS.ProsAvailable in bright coloursOffers a high screen-to-body ratioFlawless performanceImpressive camerasGreat battery backupImpressive battery lifeConsNo optical zoom capabilities.Doesn’t ship with a fast charger or Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter.
Awesome IPhone.. I have upgraded from iPhone 6 and I can notice the significant different in display, touch and XR is certainly faster. It’s worth the upgrade..! Thank you Amazon for delivering it securely..
Nice phone.
Smooth as butter, no lag and awesome display with superb camera..Just the perfect phone.
Got this phone for offer price. Everything is great from packing to delivery. Display quality is very good. Dual sim option is very good, got esim from airtel.
Been a iPhone user always. Upgraded to iPhone XR from iPhone 6 and I have no regrets. Just love the ease that face recognition brings in... freedom that 128GB memory brings in... and of course peace of mind that Apple brand name brings in..
Best mobile compare to other Apple mobiles.
Using around a week now. It’s snappy fast. Power efficient. Gives a back up of a whole day on average use. It has a single but impressive rear camera. Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides. Display is crisp..
It’s a very awesome mobile. Overall it’s really good. Hats off to apple that they provide these kinda of awesome products..
Great phone! Best ux in the class, no offense android but why does my calculator need permission to access my contacts?.
got this for a superb deal, in fact way cheaper than mu prev 7plus which i got back in late 2016. Face ID works like a charm and the display seems great for normal usage..
The product was intact. Great packaging. The phone feels amazing. It’s my first time using an iPhone and I really think the XR is worth it if you want an iPhone that doesn’t burn a deep hole in your pocket..
Value of money is excellent but little costly.
First of all I thank Amazon for such blazing fast delivery and the packaging was terrific. So trustworthy. Secondly Apple gets full marks for such a master piece. iPhone XR is capable of handling my heavy multitasking efficiently. So far so good. Reviewed after using it for almost a day. Thanks Amazon and Apple.
iPhone XR is Good and I am yet to use all features of the phone, I had used iPhone 5, 6s. Lots new features available ..
Great phone for better photos and low light battery usage is much better than XSelfie and rear camera both r much better than iphone x.
Good Priduct.
Nice phone in all respect.Only issue is high price..
WoW experience.
Amazing phone, the xs and xs max are way better but the price of this phone is the real winner. I got the fast charger and some new BT earphones woth the difference. Overall being my 1st iphone, it is really amazing.
Dude,, this phone is a beast..u will love this phone.
Wonderful, Classic One !.

NOTE:@ This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month.@ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone.This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money.BUILT QUALITY :--------------------# iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible  to easy damages.# iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR.# Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed.# To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice.DISPLAY :-----------# iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7") and XR the biggest(6.1"), with X and XS with same size(5.8"), so is the screen to body ratio.# Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P# According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :-----------------------------# I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8.# If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily.# I found X to be better value for money in this segment.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :------------------------------# All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging.# XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time.*XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours.# With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours.# Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance.CAMERA :-----------# In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera.* Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent.# XS sometimes does better over X, but not always.# Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly.# Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion.PRICE (64GB) :---------------8 - Rs.55KX - Rs.75KXR - Rs.77kXS - Rs.99K# Here certainly 8 is winner :PP.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy.VERDICT :-----------After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice.If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS.To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter.If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade.Hope this review helps..
Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees..
Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon.
It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I’m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase..
Aapse nivedan hai ki aap order conformetion mail karte hai or ya dispach informention mail karte hai, tab usme phone ki sari detail matlab IEMI no etc.. bi bheje.. taki hum service center ko dikha sake..I Want invoice .. given IMEI no on invoice not clear .. i have no proof...
The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.I would like to exchange the product with I phone xs, if possible.Kindly help. Regards & thank you..
Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon.
This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down..
Don’t buy this phone only waste of money it hang’s many time..
Extremely easy to use. Good specifications..

Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees..
Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon.
It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I’m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase..

The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.I would like to exchange the product with I phone xs, if possible.Kindly help. Regards & thank you..
Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon.
This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down..
Don’t buy this phone only waste of money it hang’s many time..
Extremely easy to use. Good specifications..
NOTE:@ This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month.@ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone.This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money.BUILT QUALITY :--------------------# iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay.

nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc..
Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?.
Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times...
Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery..
Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services.
Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model..
Jumped and coming to the feedback-1. No dedicated headphone jack- though i don't miss it but at times while traveling when my phone is running out of juice and i am charging it on the go, i wish the headphone jack was there so that i could listen to a Specific playlist and relax.2. aggressive RAM management - some apps are killed a bit too fast for my liking when not in use. but they open pretty fast again so its not much of an issue.3. no fast charger - now this is one thing i wish Xiaomi had done better. this phone supports Quick-charge 4.0+, while we are getting a normal 10W charger. the average charging time is 1 hours 20 minutes. I would recommend everyone to wait for 2-3 months to buy a certified 4.0+ Charger is released, instead of buying a Quick-charge 3.0 charger right now..
Pros:Strong performance for the priceClassy build qualityPure AndroidCons:Screen brightness low and adaptive setting way offNo NFC or headphone jackLimited availabilityKey Features5.99-inch 2160 x 1080 18:9 IPS LCD screenSnapdragon 660 octa-core 2.2GHz4GB RAM64GB of storage12MP + 20MP dual rear cameras20MP front camera3000mAh batteryFingerprint sensorVerdictThe Xiaomi Mi A2 is a phone that punches way above its weight. A few hardware shortfalls and limited availability drop it just short of an automatic recommendation, but this is deeply impressive stuff from Xiaomi.Why buy the Xiaomi Mi A2?Beyond performance this is a well-built, stylish (in a slightly derivative way) phone with a highly competent camera. The inclusion of stock Android 8.1 Oreo really completes that premium feel, and puts the Mi A2 beyond many of its affordable Chinese rivals.A couple of drawbacks prevent it from being an unequivocal recommendation, however. The Mi A2’s screen doesn’t get bright enough, and the lack of both NFC and a headphone jack are tough to swallow.Ultimately, though, the biggest downside to the Xiaomi Mi A2 is that it isn’t more widely available at the time of writing. If Xiaomi can really commit to a global launch of this range in future – and iron out those creases – it will be onto a winner..
Now matching with the expectations as well as mi standard .. coz battery life is very low ,after using the phone for 15 min phone get automatically heat .. very worst phone ..So plz don't go for it . Only waste of money ..
Got it for 16k with 6 GB ram and 128 GB storageI don't know why so many YouTuber complain about the battery lifeWell I think it's decent enough to last a day but alongside it's charging speed is fast enoughPlus the performance is great to handle any sort of games be it PUBG or anything I can play PUBG at HD setting with medium frame rates and it will consume only about 10% of battery for a full 30 min sessionThe camera is the greatest USP of the device photos are good enough in day or low light conditionOverall a good product at a decent price.
After having used this phone for a month, writing this review:Pros:1. CAMERA - the camera quality is absolutely mind blowing. the dual camera setup of 20+12 is the best in the price segment and also unmatched by any higher priced phone except for the One Plus 6. The low light pictures are pretty sharp and there is hardly any noise in the photos. the only place where the One Plus 6 beats the Mi A2 is the dynamic range, but editing the pictures in Snapseed, the levels feel at par, with the Mi A2 producing better saturated photos in daylight conditions.2. PROCESSOR- This phone feel FAST. the new Snapdragon 660 shows the raw juice it gives to the phone. combined with the 4GB of RAM. heavy multi-tasking, split screen usage, playing heavy duty games, none ot it heats up the phone or makes it lag. The fingerprint scanner is so quick that at times its annoying that on a slight nanosecond touch accidentally the phone unlocks.3. BATTERY - Before I bought the phone i read a lot of youtube reviewers spew nonsense about how crap the battery life is, and how it will not give more than 3-4 hours of On-screen time. I have been using it for a month now, and after watching HD vidoes, gaming, Video Calling and using heavy social media apps, I get around 7 hours on an average on cellular data. On wifi, one single charge gives upto 8.5 hours of On-screen time which is absolutely crazy, given that the battery is a 3010mAh battery.4. SOUND - The grilled speaker at the bottom is enough to drown a small room and does not distort the sound quality. On headphones, its pretty decent too ( recommended to invest 3k in a proper headphone if you're hoping to squeeze out the maximum out of this phone's audio capacities. )5. STOCK ANDROID - It's clean, its crispy, its fast. I love it. Stock Android fans, will love it too. And, yeah we are getting Android Pie in all probabilities by the end of this year.Now coming to the cons-1. no dedicated headphone jack- though i dont miss it but at times while traveling when my phone is running out of juice and im charging it on the go, i wish the headphone jack was there so that i could listen to a Spotify playlist and relax.2. aggressive RAM management - some apps are killed a bit too fast for my liking when not in use. but they open pretty fast again so its not much of an issue.3. no fast charger - now this is one thing i wish Xaomi had done better. this phone supports QuickCharge 4.0+, while we are getting a normal 10W charger. the average charging time is 1 hours 20 minutes. I would recommend everyone to wait for 2-3 months to buy a certified 4.0+ Charger is released, instead of buying a QuickCharge 3.0 charger right now.Overall rating from me: 9/10.This phone is as good as it gets..
The phone is like budget phone sometime it's lags & mi doesn't give a better service after purchase & all of that the phone is disaster in battery life.
This phone is good with respect to performance and camera.  But the battery is not lasting for the whole day even with nominal usage.  However, the main problem is with the proximity sensor.  While attending the calls, the loud speaker  do not disturb , torch , battery saver options are automatically get enabled/disabled due to this issue.  I first tried to return the first phone due to this issue and was able to get only a replacement after speaking to Amazon call center.  Even the same problem arise with the replaced phone as well and then I come to know that the proximity sensor is a known issue with MI A2 and still not been fixed.  People who are considering MI A2 should be aware of this issue before buying..
Don't go for it.. My experience given below....The greatest con ever pulled by xioami... Its a re modelled version of  mi4i 16 gb with no expandable memory, every thing is same but mi4i has best camera and inbuilt original mi apps they are comforting... But here in this model like someone said in this reviews section its user interface is like basic models of smart phones.Let me tell u cons and pros.Pros:Android one (it may work).Cons:No MI inbuilt appsMinimal battery lifeIts given as 20 mp camera, but pictures are bot upto the mark when compared to 12mp dual camera both looks like same pics. My redmi note 4 camera is best when i compare with mia2.No face unlockI don't know why they have given typec removing earphones jack.NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY SLOT.NO OTGConclusion :Its like any other basic smartphone with 5.99 screen resolutions, many features are missing.. The user interface is not user friendly.. If u used mi phones earlier u will come to know whats missing.The biggest drawback of this phone is no return policy that means if u go purchase it its ur karma to decide u will keepit urselve or sell it for half rate after u disappointed, regretted, sad and feedup using it.Don't go for it.. Unless u want to waste ur money on it..
Premium metal build, andriod one and epic camera is the highlight of this device, some great features are IR blaster type c fast charging notification led which takes around 80 mins. To charge from 5-100% ...camera bump is not too big. Till now no issue while using it from 5 days sound is also too good nd loud.
The first few days the phone was good and then all the issues started to crop up.  The phone stopped working in one month and the Mi service replaced the motherboard.  After changing the motherboard and re-installing the applications the battery is giving weird experience.  The top battery percentage shows 100%; whereas when I got to battery app it shows 46%.  The phone at times doesn't get charged even though the battery icon changes to charging mode.  The google maps software when in directions mode freezes when we got a call (while driving).  Xiaomi doesn't have any support to report bugs on software, the chat agent asked me to drop to the nearest service centre to re-image the phone.  The only good feature of the phone is its camera other than that I don't recommend this phone..
Plz do not buy the phone....As the camera is defective....I have purchased 5 phones to gift my family members for Diwali.....All failed in blancco software test conducted through Amazon customer care......I have posted the pic as well.....multiple lines were coming while clicking the picture under tube light.....As the other phones doesn't...Mi4iY2S7....EtcAll where fine...except this model of mi.....
Don't buy just for camera ,even my phone have problem in camera. Battery is low, fast charger not provided in box, No jack, Not expandable memory card slot ,there are much better option at this price  even cheaper than it..
Display quality is amazing(TRUE HD) as compared to previous models, both battery and sound quality is up to the mark ,BUT BUT BUTthe touch of this phone is too much sensitive , without even tapping the screen sometimes it respond, its frustrating sometimes to type a msg on this phone,.
Pros - Camera, display , call reception is good.Cons -1.So far no android 9 update. Others like Nokia 6.1 received update.2.No customer support and warranty registration like Nokia which has dedicated app for customer support.3. Adaptive brightness makes screen dull even after adjusting brightness better to turn off this feature.4. bugs in selecting ringtones and alerts like sometimes it shows 3 options to choose sometimes 25. Battery doesn't last whole day even on home wifi.Note - Received Android P update today. all good..
Battery backup is totally ridiculous instead of mi note 5 pro software functions not good.
This mobile has many drawbacks such as1-Headphone port is not available, only one common port for charging and headphone2-No call recorder in it3-No gallery4-Phone Memory cannot be expanded after 64gb5-Not any privacy app so that we can manage our pictures, video, and app form others6-No additional app or features in it from their previous phone7-Only 3000mAh battery at least 3200mAh battery should be given at this price8-waste of money totally.
Quickly discharged in 6 hrsCamera good.

It is over a month I purchased this phone and using this since, Here is my experience with this buddy:Boons:1. Ergonomics:  Was worried about its size, but found it very pleasant on hand as width is optimal and has very slim profile, although one may need little deep pocket for keeping in normal trousers, and gives some discomfort when you use denim trousers. Soft case provided along with package is plain but good enough to keep your phone safe.2. Battery: Having battery of 3010 mAh battery gives little fear on battery life. But in practice it is well compensated by energy efficient processor. One can happily use this phone 3-4 hours and will find remaining battery life is still around 50%.3. Sound: Cristal clear sound without any distortion or noise is one of the big gift this phone gives.4. Processor: Snapdragon 660 is real workhorse for phones of this range, nothing can beat it for next 6 months at this price point. Having 4 GB of RAM enables this phone to perform hassle-free while Google updates are going at background.5. Camera: Very high quality pictures irrespective of the lighting condition, did not notice any noise in the image produced by this buddy.6. Google One: Having a phone having all the necessary software without any bloat ware is bliss. One is not going to face any lag or heating issue for normal loads. I found it very user friendly after couple of days of familiarization with its atmosphere.7. Fingerprint Scanner: Very fast, but I switched to pin number as per expert advice.Banes:1. No Factory Installed Screen Guard: It is biggest bane for me, this phone has. Getting right screen guard with right dimensions is tough, and tougher is to fix it with company provided soft case.2. Lacking Fast Charger: The phone supports Quick Charge 4.0+, and I got a normal 10W charger. What is this, like running a sport car on Coal Fuel? Great disappointment.3. Missing Headphone Jack: The phone comes along with adopter but somehow I am not happy about it.4. Missing dedicated Memory Slot: One have to compromise in this area, but OK, they want you to use Google drive instead.Overall Rating 8/10PS: Self is mid-light user in general, weekend usage is somewhat heavy. Mostly use this device for You tube, net surfing and chatting, but no gaming..
Picture quality overrated in so many reviews..i find it jusk ok in comparison to MI5.. since this mobile has stock android so you will not get the basic features of mobile like- gallery, three fingers screen shot,second space, double tap on screen to wake etc.. very disappointing.. also during video call you get your picture(caller's pic) very tiny and blurred and round shaped..i will say its just ok handset..only plus point is it comes with gorilla glass 5.
Good phone but sensors are not good. While calling screen brightens up automatically.Camera - Superb.Sound-  Superb.Built Quality - OkCons: Call sim preference always gets to sim 1 when you switch off and switch on again even if you have selected sim 2 as the preference..
Powerful hardware nd superior picture quality... But battery backup in not very good.
It's a really terrible experienced with mi a2 battery life is so disappointing need to charge 3-4 times a day even don't play any games manufacturer should fix these problem otherwise it's very hard to continue with these phone and need to drop and move to other brandcamera is also stuck when clicking continuesly 2-3 pic don't know why....?Overall very bad expirience to have these not satisfying service these time.
Good:1. Can get charged fast due to dash charger support.Issues:1. Common node for both head phone and mobile charging2. Battery draining is so fast.3. User interface is not that handy. Need to play around to understand how it is working.4. Not catching up 4G correctly. Tried with Airtel and Idea both...5. don't have SD card slot.Suggestion:don't go for it for this model at value you spend (almost 20K Rs.).
Buttery smooth ..This phone will give u a ultimate smooth experience with Android pie update ..when I 1st use the phone it sort of lag and battery is about 6 hrs screen on time .Then I update it to pie then it become perfect ..No issue with headphone jack or sound quality of the speaker for me .Screen looks very good. and now battery backup is increasing to 8-9 hours screen on time with normal usages. ..Camera is excellent. Screen is nice .slim ,good to hold. Screen look a bit old but overall desing is Ok ..but performance is high really really high ..I am satisfied with the device till now ..
1) Battery draining fastly compare to other mobile same 3000mbh battery mobile,2) Display poor visibility in sunlight condition3) 3.5 Audio Jack not available4) No External Memory card5) Price to high.Not worth for this mobile Rs.14999First Don't buy this phone and after order Amazon website not accept return and refund.i am so irritated because of this phone.
I have written negative review of this phone just after a week use. Battery was draining in just 5-6 hour, phone was heating like iron box. But it suddenly changed after a factory reset. My phone has got Android pie update.  I did not reset the phone after update which was the main reason for heating and battery drain. So my recommendation to any one updating to pie is to reset the phone after update and don't forget to backup ur phone before doing that. Now phone is not at all have heating issue additionally battery lasts comfortably for 24-30 hour depending on use. Now battery standby is amazingly 3 days. I am glad to change my opinion about my Mi A2.
Censors are not working properly.phone get heated while charging and normal use.It seems like this phone is made to keep it sub-par delibrately with other MI /RedMi phone.Not a single thing is optimise in this phone.Android very is still 8.1 that also not optimise for phone..
Very Poor performance.Touch- very poorCamera key function.  Very poorScreen shot facility--- not availableVideo recording icon --not availablePicture quality. Very poor.
First of all, battery is not an issue. It easily pulls through a full day on regular usage of ½ hour calling, 2 hours of YouTube, 1 hour of WhatsApp & Facebook. I used only WiFi, so I don't know if 4G drains the battery. I got this for my Dad who doesn't play games at all & has WiFi both at home n office. His main requirement was long lasting as he was using HTC since past 3 yrs. So I suggested him a Snapdragon 660 mobile phone as it wouldn't slow down at least for 2-3 yrs on regular usage.Now some Pros:1. Good screen indoors. All Redmi phones are poor in sunlight legibility (incl. my Note 5 Pro).2. Full metal design (though reduces signal reception) & light weight.3. Superior camera compared to my Note 5 Pro.4. Great processor & good Ram management.5. Low charging time (even on regular charger).6. Loud ringtone.7. Cover is nice.Now some Cons:1. Sound from speaker for media is pathetic.2. Instead of a USB to 3.5mm dongle, proper USB headphones should have been provided.3. Red colour is lighter & looks pinkish (feminine).4. Signal reception is mediocre maybe due to all metal body.5. No face unlock.Android One is good for no bloatware but poor in functionality. Very basic - not a feature rich OS unlike Note 5 Pro..
Very bad product...I can't imagine mi will manufacturer this kind of product. Battery life is very very bad.....this is the experience after using 2 days of mi A2....guys don't buy this ... battery is very poor...already raised my complain to Amazon but they are saying I can't exchange this mobile....only replacement can be done with same mobile....very bad ....Dear Amazon team plz don't allow mi to sell this product on Amazon.....
All the thing is superb except battery life .And camera is beast in lowlight and day light.but issue is that in mobile that battery is so poor and without notch but  overall good phone .and we are using extremely level we charge battery two time on a day..
This phone has not been given basics which is battery and 3.5mm jack. After using this phone for a month I feel like left alone from this world.It's like a beautiful building on a very weak foundation. How many pictures would you click when you have serious battery issues.I normally don't write reviews but this phone has pissed me off.It's my fault that I didn't read the reviews before buying this. Thanks to the last time of Diwali sale.
Very good phone for the price but what a horrible proximity sensor issue. Every time you make a call, the speaker or flashlight or mute button will be pressed and its annoying. I really hope they fix it with the software update..
Buy for:1) Amazing Camera: Suberb colour captures in daylight and amazing details at night. Google Ai light enhancement is also available post clicking the image in low light. EIS stabilization is now available in 4K and Slo-mo video as well.2) Updates: Monthly security patches, bug fixes and improvements directly by Google, before any other Mi phone.3) Stock Android: It's beautiful, fast and cluster free. Google seamlessly integrates a lot of features with Google assistant. Though not as feature rich as MiUi.5) Hardware: Snapdragon 660 coupled with 128 GB internal and 6GB RAM ensures ultra smooth and fast performance, irrespective of how many apps are simultaneously open in the background. You'll hardly notice them.6) Fast Charge: This phone support QC Fast Charge 4.0 but sadly Xiaomi provides a standard charger with the phone.Don't Buy for:1) Battery: It's small, it lasts maximum a day on low to medium usage. Wish they could squeeze in the battery from Redmi Note 5 Pro.2) Features: Stock andoird means it lacks a lot of basic functions, features and apps which one might take for granted in custom skins like MiUi. Like a barcode/document scanner, WiFi share via QR code, etc.3) Storage: No SD card slot means that 128GB internal is all that you will have. If that is an issue for some, it can be a deal breaker.4) No Audio Jack: It lacks a 3.5mm audio jack. They do provide a USB-C to 3.5mm converter, but it essentially means, you can't use you headphones while charging the phone (which you might need to due to its low battery capacity). Also, when using regular headphones/earphones through the convertor, the end quality of the sound is just not as good. Better to invest in Bluetooth or USB-C headphones for that matter..
SUPERB camera phone.quality of the photos are great. under low light it also does very good job. battery quality is not so good. battery drains too fastly. face recognition works perfectly..
Battery life is not goodTheir are so many options which are not their in this phone(we will get those options in lesser configuration phone, like double tap, contacts deletion option)Here in this phone once login with our mail , contacts will come to our conct app, but one contact will repeat four to five times. And we can't delete multiple contact at a time.Their is internet tracker option.Their is no proper geature option.Totally this phone is not user friendly.They have given software life as 9 rate out of 10 . But I will say software is 5/10 .Waste ,worst phone with the 18 k.I wasted my 18k for this kind of waste phone.Please don't with this phone..
I don't know why others gave the low rating, but at this price, this phone is really awesome with 660 Snapdragon SOC, fast charge 4+, Stock android and with Pie update out of box, seriously this is worth a purchase. Don't get confused by other ratings, phone is really a charm. The sleekiness, display output , everything just looks awesome. Especially Camera, it's way better than any phone in this price range. Only one word " JUST GO FOR IT ".  I bought Rose gold and yes I Love it. The charger in box doesn't capable of fast charge, but a third party charger like belkin can definitely get you quick charge 4+.Pros:1. Display2. Camera3. Sleek4. 660 Snapdragon( no other phones comes with this SOC at this price)5. Android One - Stock Android6. Pure Speed at it's bestCons:Should have provided the fast output charger, but that doesn't make this phone any less.Thank you..
The red colour shown in product page in amazon website is not the original colour. its kinda more of pink colour than red. (check some mi a2/6x video in youtube) after setting up account & SIM activation, touchscreen latency becomes very much visible & after 3 hrs, no response for touch. Phone is active, power button works, but cant open any apps or anything.Just a display device with lock-screen/wallpaper. :(have requested for replacement on day one. waiting for technician..
Pros:1. Picture quality is very nice including low light photographs. The front camera is far better than the rear camera.2. Loved the slo mo as well as the time lapse video features. Generally this feature is available in high end phones.3. Screen is slightly curved and not flat.4. Feels very thin.5. Upgradable to Pie which is a feel good factor.6. Good sound quality too.7. Quite fast charging.Cons1. Battery life is not too good. Needs to be charged before evening with normal use.2. Uses a USB type C connector for charging as well as headphones. Though it comes with a USB type C to 3.5 mm adapter so your old headphones are good but if the battery is dying then you can either recharge it or just listen to audio. Kind of a discouraging feature..
Everytime when I go out of City and come back from an area of no coverage, my phone shows no network at all.Even if I search for network manually, it shows SIM network but it can't register to that network..
Phone is not working properly and getting hanged.
Looks:  Pros: sleek, beautiful and graceful ... Feels nice to hold  Con: Metallic back starts loosing Matt effect because of dust that gets stuck in sftey coverCamera:  Pros: Nice dynamic range, good camera quality in low light as well for this budget, quick focus, equivalent quality of front camera  Con: lag while taking photograph from front camera in portrait mode only, slow motion videos editing is messy.Battery:  You need to be cautious with that, it doesn't house a battery enough for a device with such specs. After 1 month of use a complete battery lasts for 6-7 hours with a mix use of gaming, listening musinc and surfic over web, and roughly 25% ideal.Performance:  So far Chipset has not made me reget the decision. Whether it being playing asphalt or and any other game with running music in background or rendering adobe premier projects the device holds on to the fame.In House Speaker:  It is loud but quality is not that good... Buy a music system along with a nice headset for that, instead of spending 18 grands more to buy a better handset :POther Pros:- has IR remoteOther Cons:- no 3.5mm jack- no expandable memory- big camera hump at back.
Purchased the phone on 13th October and I already wish I had returned the phone when I still could. I was hopelessly waiting for the promised "updates" to fix the issues. Here are just some of them-The proximity sensor is as good as not having it. You would rather want to use earphones then go through the trouble of checking if mistakenly the flashlight has been switched on with the ear taps on the screen.Oh, but that will only last so long. Because sooner than all other phones I have used, this needs to be put to charge.Like it's not bad enough, my display starts flickering occasionally and sometimes the GPS sensor just won't work. Until you reboot ofcourse, because why not..
Hats off to the amazon offer I got my mi a2 @12500 with sbi card offer and amazon pay cash back.Phone is good but the only thing which I'm missing a headphone jack..
I was using mi A1 before I bought mi A2 I think this has a lot of issues,from couple of days my phone doesn't ring due this I'm missing a lot of important calls battery life is a major set back for this phone..
was concerned about the battery life (especially cos was using a 4k battery phone before, but its been almost 3 years and its life was much reduced) but was happy with the result, consistently giving me 5-5.5 hours of sot (i dont play games). the camera is another strong point in its range, updates are fast, been a week, already got a few of them. wish the camera bump wasn't that big. the in-hand feel is great..
only camera is Good, phone doesn't have as much options as lower modal has. I updated phone 3 times, still not functionality, like limited shortcuts, no gesture, no inbuilt ringtones, no auto call recording. I am regrading after purchasing this mobile..
I bought Mi A2  4Gb ram + 64 Gb as a gift for my hubby first, and the same day the price of this phone went down 2,000 rupees. My bad! He wanted a more powerful one with 6 Gb and 128 gb which was also reduced in price. So, I had to order again. Price wise its good. Have to use it and see the durability. Camera quality is awesome, red comes out more. Helps in case you have color blindness to see red LOL..
I had high hopes with Xiaomi's Android One offering, heard lots of praise for the A1 and when A2 was launched in India grabbed one during the festival offer period. The first thing that I noticed when I switched on the mobile was the yellow band on the bottom of the screen, thought it might be a glue issue and will fade away but its been one and half month and its still there. But the problems just started for me. From last ten days or so there is distortion in the speaker and the tinny sound it makes is unbearable, its really random. Then from the last 3-4 days the front facing camera is not working, all I get is an error message stating the camera can't be connected, took it to a nearest service center where they told me the issues were software related and a fresh software installation will solve those issues, they did flash a newer(according to them) firmware but the problems were still there. They acknowledged that the issue was hardware related but they didn't have the spares to change them and suggested me to take it to other big service center. When I took the mobile to the 'other' service center they are simply stating that the issue is software related despite telling them that a newer firmware was flashed day before and didn't even accept the phone for service. Didn't expect this from Xiaomi. And not to forget the memory management issues it has, try to delete a large file or clear Google Chrome cache, the mobile will hang and sometimes we have to reboot to get it working. This is 4th Xiaomi device that bought after Mi 3 in the very first flash sale itself then the Redmi Note 3 and Mi 4A, and by far the worst Xiaomi device I have ever owned.PS: I didn't even mention the proximity sensor issues!Stay away..
Battery life is worst. just 3 days back I got n had taken it to a picnic, battery didn't last till afternoon , I had to ask others to make a call, such a pathetic condition, I'm really frustrated with this, regretting for having bought this, couldn't even return as I exchanged it with my old phone honor 5x which was in good condition only. I just wanted a good battery and more RAM n ROM. Another major problem is charger is not a standard charger . It has many good features, but those are compensated for , by equally terrible features like battery backup. And also at the same price, you can find much better phones which have maximum screen to body ratio..
I was happy with my Mi A1 untill I broke it's screen.Upgrading to Mi A2 looks like a better option than to replace the screen for 4-5k with a measly 6 months warranty.I was horribly mistaken.I was so happy with my Mi A1 that it didn't even occur to me to for any other phone.So bought the 64GB variant even after seeing a warning video about it's battery backup in YouTube.The battery drains like anything.It has been only a month of using it.I primarily use my phone for music,shopping, WhatsApp or simple browsing.Do not use GPS.Still it drains my battery.Even after killing all the background apps when I'm not using it.If I charge my phone to 100 percentage and then traveling for 20 mins listening to some songs.By the time I arrive at my destination my battery back up will be somewhere around 70-80 percentage.So disappointed.I travel a lot.So looks like I'll always have to carry my powebank in future.Also even though it charges phone quick,it overheats phone upto 48-50 degrees.Feels like it will blast at any moment.I generally discharge it cool it down and again charge it till end.The lack of separate earphone point than the charging point is definitely a negative point.As you can't use earphone while charging it.But I bought the phone even after knowing this one.So I'll keep my dissatisfaction to myself on that one.The only one star is for the red colour.i loved the color.But never have I been so disappointed in my life with any of my phones..
Mi A2 will be the most powerful Android One phone from Xaiomi to date.It employs 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 mobile processor matted to Adreno 512 GPU,The SD 660 has an immaculate track record. and we will become quite happy with the performance we are getting on Mi A2.The Mi A2 has a USB Type-C (based on USB 2.0), Bluetooth 5.0, has an IR blaster and mono bottom-firing speaker. Amidst all these connectivity options,Xiaomi ditched the 3.5 headphone jack. So yes, the Mi A2 has no headphone jack and no microSD card slot.Moving on, the Mi A2 has Dual SIM Dual 4G LTE support out of the box. The phone comes with 3,010mAh battery, bundled with a 10W charger.The Mi A2 India variant is compatible with Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4+ technology from the day one..
The overall phone is good, sound quality is also nice. affordable, stock android , processor speed is good, type 'c' charger are good features.But, I really hate this phone as1. you can either charge the phone or listen the songs as same port is used for both... If your phone is drained out and you want to call someone.... you can't charge a phone and have a call together or listen songs during charging2. AI selfie camera actually nothing but like beatification tools.3. 20 Mega pixel camera is just a word and picture quality is poor.
The legendary smartphone with Android One. Out-of-the-box runs Oreo, 8.1, soon upgraded to 9, Pie. Cameras are good, not the best, dark shots are blurry. Sound quality is low, not as expected. Tears in loud sounds. Battery life is not good. 3300 mAh, lasts only a day for 7 to 8 hours screen on time. Overall performance is smooth, thanks to Qualcomm Snapdragon 660, and 4GB RAM. 64 GB version is enough for typical day to day usage and apps. Lack of headphone jack and micro SD card doesn't bother for a daily user, not any media fanatic. Great device..
The display and picture quality is amazing.. 6gb ram ensures the phone is super smooth. Totally worth it .There are downsides as well (what i felt)1) 3.5 mm jack missing.. we have to use a c-type to 3.5mm adaptor (included in d box) to connect normal headphones. In case if you forget to carry the adaptor, you cant connect it to aux or connect headphones.2) does not support memory card. In case if you have data from your previous phone on a memory card, you cannot mount it directly on the phone.Overall.. a superb phone..
In moved from iOS to Android, needed a phone which works lagfree and gets regular security updates (so my corporate email keeps working).Had a choice between Nokia 6.1+ and Mi A2. Took this one for bigger, notchless (seriously its distracting) screen.Only issue is it's battery, with high screen time and 4G, the battery at times dies out in less than a day..
The phone is really good.Camera :Camera performance is outstanding...Device is capable of taking high quality pictures.Stabilization while recording 1080p video is really good.Unfortunately there is no stabilization for 4k recording.Battery:The battery is not the best or worse.Its just average..I can squeeze one day of battery life from the phone.Software: Software is the best.I can see some bugs after the pie update, but its fast and responsive, ofcourse its Android one.Its free of blotwares and ads.Display:Display colors are really good.Display is capable of producing good colors and viewing angle is also nice.But it won't light up much..Using the phone under direct sunlight is really hard because of the low brightness.The phone gets a bit warm on normal usage, but nothing to worry.The speaker is really loud and got some depth to it.There is no headphone jack, but the quality is amazing.Both sims are 4g and both are working perfectly.Cell reception and cellular call quality are top notch.Gaming is also smooth.But because of the average battery life, games like Pubg can drain the battery in a couple hours.None the less, its awesome to play pubg in this phone its lag free and really smooth.This review is based on the experience from one week usage of the MI A2.It really is a camera phone.I would recommend this phone to those who love to take a lot of pictures and selfies...
Reviewing the Mi A2 after 1 month of intensive usage.PROS- Build Quality is pretty good. The metal back makes it slippery but also more durable than the glass used on some phones. Personally, I feel glass is justified only if the phone has wireless charging. So the metal body is definitely an advantage.- Software is clean without any bloatware. Android One means that updates happen on regular basis.- Performance is buttery smooth. Snapdragon 660 is an able chipset and I did not notice any lag. I have the 6 GB + 128 GB variant. Storage is enough for me. Memory management is also pretty good on the unit I got.- Camera is a real highlight. The secondary 20 MP sensor is a real improvement in low light conditions. It brightens the images considerably although some noise is present. Daylight shots are very pleasing. You can argue the Poco F1 has similarly good camera but it Mi A2 wins the low light game by a fair margin. Selfie camera is also pretty good, offering a lot of detail and portrait mode with software.- Speaker is mono but really loud.CONS- Battery life is the only con I could find. I get a screen on time of about 4.5 hours with moderate usage. The provided charging brick can charge the phone in less than 1.5 hours. It would have been better if they included a QuickCharge 4.0 brick also.P.S. Lack of headphone jack as a con varies from user to user. I use wireless earphones. USB type C to 3.5mm converter is included, but if you have a habit of losing small cables, then it may be an issue for you.FINGERPRINT SENSOR BUGThis bug has affected many devices. All cores remain at full throttle and reduces battery life. I tested this on my unit and fortunately, this does not have such an issue. My unit uses FPR sensor. Users with Goodix sensor have complained of this bug. To find out what sensor you have, insert  * # * # 64663 # * # *Concluding, the Poco F1 may look like a better value for money proposition, and it may be for some people. I am fan of Stock Android experience and found that several features of the Poco F1 are unrefined. The cameras are also slightly better on Mi A2. So if you are looking for a performance all-rounder with great set of cameras, I feel Mi A2 should be your first choice below 20k..
I did lot of research on latest phones and finally got this during Dussehra sale for 12,500Rs (incl all offers).Pros:- This phone is equipped with Sony sensors because of which the picture quality is like the one's taken from premium cameras.- You can even shoot videos in 4K.- Though it is of 6inch, it is handy to use.- Good battery life. I keep 4G on all the time and one time charge is sufficient for the entire day.- Received complimentary phone case designed my MI- No lag in accessing apps that consume lot of space and RAM. One can play games like Sniper 3D without any lag.Cons:- You wont get earphones with this phone.- Regular Samsung charger doesn't work with this phone..
This is the most amazing phone for under 16,000/-It has a full HD 1920 x 1080 screen resolution and flawlessly watched full HD movies without skipping or jerks. I used my Amazon Prime account to stream video through my WiFi connection.The camera features, though not very great, are pretty impressive. and include the 1/2.9" sensor size, 1.25 µm pixel size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR, panorama capebilities.Other Sensors include a fingerprint scanner in the back, an accelerometer, a gyro, a proximity sensor, a compass.Last but not least, it comes with Corning Gorilla glass-3 screen guard already installed for extra durability.All in all, this is the best phone at this price. There is nothing else that comes even close. I recommend this totally..
Just Bought this phone a month ago... I know this is not a high end flagship phone, but for what I get it's price I am very Happy.However there is something I wish they would do different (without significantly affecting it's price.. I think),1. The Camera Hump is one if the biggest I have seen on a smartphone, why couldn't they just make the whole whole a bit thicker, to level up the camera hump (this phone is VERY thin, a millimeter or more couldn't hurt it's design)... that way they could have put more battery capacity a bit bigger (the 3000mah is a BIT too small for 6" screen operation)2 The proximity sensor is a joke, often after ending a call, Ia would get random apps or setting opened due to my skin touching the screen doing calls... they could have made it a bit better for this kind of price3. Adaptive brightness is quite bad for a phone at this price range, so I just use manual brightness setting.4. And for a few rupees more, I wish they put in NFC, Because I use NFC alot on my previous phone.for proximity sensor and adaptive brightness is waaay better on my previous Nokia Lumia 730 phoneBut Overall I am happy with this phone, the Camera Is Great, no lagging so far..
FULL REVIEW ON PHONE - So look this phone is great. It cost me 15000 and works great with Airtel. I live out in the country so I always look at cell providers service map and Airtel map is highly detailed regarding the kind of service you will get. This phone actually gets better reception then what there map says I should. Xiaomi is eyeing up the India market in 2018 so they are gearing a lot of there phones to be fully compatible with India cell carriers and this phone is no exception. The LTE bands work great. I have Mint Mobile who is a MVNO through Airtel and I get up to 100mbps with them when I have full service with this phone. The phone has a GREAT Snapdragon 660 AI Processor. This is the cheapest phone you will find that comes with an authentic Snapdragon 660. Because it has such a great processor it is very quick and runs games like Players Unknown Battleground and Asphalt 9 on the highest settings without any frame rate loss. However, if you are a Fortnite player due to restrictions on the GPU card that is paired with the SnapDragon 660, it won't be able to run it at this time. That's on Fortnite's end not the phones end. If it can run PUBG fine on the highest settings it surely could run Fortnite. The finger print scanner is super fast.The phone is fully upgradable to Android Pie 9.0. A lot of phones come with bloatware however this phone does not. It comes with Android One which is the organic version of Android Pie not some companies overlays and skins. Basically Android One is the way Android was designed to run from Google. Because there is no bloatware it adds to the speed.This phone is great. Works great and it's updated.Better then Redmi Note 5 Pro and that was a good phone. I have both. The difference between the 2 are below that made me get the Mi A2 and stood with it.- Better Camera. (Front and Back)- USBC Charger- Thinner body- Updates with Android One- Pure Android OS. (MIUI is not bad but I prefer pure)- AI Camera-Snapdragon 660The only benefit I found with the Note 5 Pro is the battery. I do like MIUI Rom also. But the Mi A2 is better for me. Both phones are great but the A2 is better in my world but your world might be differentI get LTE on both phone in NYC.The Choice is Yours!!!.
Mobile basic feature problem like mute notification sound and deleting multiple contactsound is too loud...MI Need to be resolve that issues firstmy recommendation dont buy this phone go for Samsung (Dual Sim users) or Apple(Single Sim users).
Hi.. i am using this phone for last 2 month. I would like to share some of real reviews about this phone.Before this phone i was using moto g4 play. I decided to swith to a new phone as i am working in it company. I need a good phone that can help me out with my multiple task. But my budget was around 15k -19k. I took a decision to go with MI A2.Good thing-- having a advantage of google stock phone, less inbuilt application. Good performance due it.- it is very sleek phone..you will love to keep this phone in hand as compare other brand phone.- good bettery life. Perform really well- screen display quality is good.- camera quality is goodNegative Thing -- i am really very disappointed with the music output in earphone by this phone. Headphone lover will not like it. Some i have to use my old phone Motorola for music satisfaction. Amazing sound output quality in moto phone.- You will feel bad when you want to listen music in this phone and you missed 3.5 mm connecting pin because this phone not having dedicated 3.5 mm jack.- camera is not as good as it should be in low light. It some time click blur images in low light.Overall i give 8/10 in this budget range. But highly recommend to them who do not want to spend more money. Bettery and look is best in this class.Thanks.
The phone is good, pictures clicked are decent at the price point. The display is good. Adaptive brightness does not work seamless. The phone is fast; it has been 3 months and phone seems to be holding good with response time.One flip side is available storage capacity. For a phone of 64 GB, the available storage is just 46 GB. Other phones get roughly 50-55 GB for usage.One needs a launcher to use the phone effectively. Nova and Microsoft launcher works very well.The sound is loud, I've to keep the phone ringer at half, otherwise it is too loud. The audio playback sound level is handsome.I'm into videos big time. I keep watching videos and play games and the battery comfortably lasts for 24 hrs.Android P is long overdue..
I am using my a2 for 15 days and here what I think about it,Firstly about performance: It has SD660 that is a powerful processor so performance is pretty nice.And due to Android one it has a smooth ui.But it have couple of bugs in fingerprint scanner and face unlock. When you use it's fingerprint scanner it's battery drains very fast and the reason is because fingerprint scanner use phone's all 8 cores on full power.So I started to use face unlock that is very fast and accurate but after a week it also start having problem and I had to re register my face.Camera: Both front and rear cameras are good.Image quality is good.Video quality is also good but slow motion video quality is below average.Battery life:I read all bad reviews about it's bad battery life but it is not that bad.If you are not a heavy user then it will last whole day except if  you use it's face unlock instead of fingerprint. Because it's fingerprint sensor have a bug due to which battery drains very rapidly.And I hope that will be fixed in future update.Build quality: It's a very slim phone because of it's small 3000 mah battery. But because of it phone has very tall camera bump and I suggest  not to  use it without any protective case..
I am using the phone for last 3 months, and it is a great phone. Also the Android 9 update came by early December. So it's  great device from Xiaomi.  The camera, both the front and back are awesome. The image quality and speed of the phone is really good. The fingerprint sensor is fast, however there is some issue in face lock feature. Some time it will work, some time it wont work. May be there are some bugs for, so it behaves in this way. The biggest con is the battery. If it was around 4000mah, then it would have been an unbeaten phone in this category. In moderate use, it will last for the whole day. But heavy usage might last for 8-9 hours maximum. So I found only thses 2 cons after 2 months of heavy usage. Other than that, it is nice one in this budget to go..
Phone camera app got frozen on very first day even without any new app installation. Further while installing new apps again play Store app got frozen in such a way that I couldn't make it to go back..
I dont know whats is happening to Xiaomi, they are becoming the rockstar of bugs in UI. They had so much of talent that they can have bugs in stable stock Andoid(OREO).It just a second day with MI A2 and i found its lagging too much and after taking pictures its takes too much time to preview the pic, while watching Amazon prime the back button is not working.Since 2014 i was using MI phones, at starting stage they had good hardware with well organised UI. MIUI was the USP of Xiaomi and now its the one of the reason i didn't choose the Xiaomi.At this time i would prefer Realme products at least they don't have silly Bugs.
Functiona are not better in mi a2.
I have bought this recently.. I feel it's so slim and nice to carry. But few of the things I just wanted to mention..1. Radio jack port is not available .. every time you need to carry external small cable given as USB supported to put radio jack. So need to carry all the times.2. Sound quality.. when I put max then only it is audible clearly. Average if I put.. it's hearing very low. Hence always max required.3. Back camera is not good. Of course given in device spec.4. Battery backup is good.5. Location service will be automatically make on when you open any location services app. So no short cut provided in status bar menu..
It is good phone with awesome specifications  but sometimes the phone has bugs here and there might be software issue may be it will get solved through updates and pubg mobile game works smoothly but makes phone lag often don't know why. Otherwise its a good phone at this price and is value for money . The camera is the best thing of this phone and the pure Android feels good . And got the Android pie update yesterday only , I will update the review soon. It's better than realme 2 pro nd Asus max 2 pro becoz of its over clocked processor.
Battery sucks and heats up.
Be aware of pros and cons of this phone and android 1 before purchase.  just cons-no on-device backup and restore like that of in miui. only via google. so making your A2 just like your old mi phone is merely impossible. type c connentor for headphone is irritating and inconvinient one. the converter (type c to 3.5mm) stops working already. more over in phones connecting headphone via this converter have low audio loudness as compare to phones with  3.5 mm jack. some times in travelling you cant even listen audio while watching movies. though it have quick charge and its really covinient but for those who use phone hotspot, battery discharges really quick. so more charging cycles of short duration yet battery life is compromised . hangs on attending calls like screen turn back to on during call and other function start to on-off with our cheeks like call gets mute, loudspeaker grtting on-off etc. rest all is good like camera, display and performance..
Camera, Camera and Camera.
nothing great, other than camera.
All good except type C connector.
Competent Android One smartphone with a few major flaws(and they are not what you think).
Best mobile phone & Amazon Faster delivery..

A worthy deal !.
Buy, if it's the last available phone..
Great offer by Amazon.

great at reduced price of 12k, was even better for me as 2k extraa off on exchange.
Overall a great experience with some small sacrifices.

So far good.
Nice phone in a good price.
A2 is plagued with issues, stay away.
Worst battery backup..
Awful battery backup..

Good choice for non media centric users..
Overall.. an awesome phone.
A complete package.
Its Definitely Worth Buying..
Unbeatable software and camera at this price point.
A Camera phone with Sony sensors.
This is absolutely the best phone in this range hands down. Must buy. Highly recommended..
Good phone.
Great Phone all around. Better then the Redmin Note 5 Pro!.
Underrated device!.
Mobile basic feature problem like mute notification sound and deleting multiple contact.
Before Buying see my real reviews.
Decent phone, okay camera, less storage than competition.
A decent phone, performance and look wise, but have few bugs in fingerprint and face unlock..
A worthy item in Android one section.
Poor performance (app freezing issue, battery).
as usual full of bugs.
Battery is very bad.
Good one.
Nice specs and value for money.
Heating Issue.
NOT A Mi Phone At All..
Not Impressed. could have been perfect. but there is a reason for continous price drop. isn’t it ?.
nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc..
Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?.
Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times...

Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services.
Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model..
Jumped and coming to the feedback-1. No dedicated headphone jack- though i don't miss it but at times while traveling when my phone is running out of juice and i am charging it on the go, i wish the headphone jack was there so that i could listen to a Specific playlist and relax.2. aggressive RAM management - some apps are killed a bit too fast for my liking when not in use. but they open pretty fast again so its not much of an issue.3. no fast charger - now this is one thing i wish Xiaomi had done better. this phone supports Quick-charge 4.0+, while we are getting a normal 10W charger. the average charging time is 1 hours 20 minutes. I would recommend everyone to wait for 2-3 months to buy a certified 4.0+ Charger is released, instead of buying a Quick-charge 3.0 charger right now..

A few hardware shortfalls and limited availability drop it just short of an automatic recommendation, but this is deeply impressive stuff from Xiaomi.Why buy the Xiaomi Mi A2?Beyond performance this is a well-built, stylish (in a slightly derivative way) phone with a highly competent camera. The inclusion of stock Android 8.1 Oreo really completes that premium feel, and puts the Mi A2 beyond many of its affordable Chinese rivals.A couple of drawbacks prevent it from being an unequivocal recommendation, however. The Mi A2’s screen doesn’t get bright enough, and the lack of both NFC and a headphone jack are tough to swallow.Ultimately, though, the biggest downside to the Xiaomi Mi A2 is that it isn’t more widely available at the time of writing. If Xiaomi can really commit to a global launch of this range in future – and iron out those creases – it will be onto a winner..

Jumped and coming to the feedback-1. No dedicated headphone jack- though i don't miss it but at times while traveling when my phone is running out of juice and i am charging it on the go, i wish the headphone jack was there so that i could listen to a Specific playlist and relax.2. aggressive RAM management - some apps are killed a bit too fast for my liking when not in use. but they open pretty fast again so its not much of an issue.3. no fast charger - now this is one thing i wish Xiaomi had done better. this phone supports Quick-charge 4.0+, while we are getting a normal 10W charger. the average charging time is 1 hours 20 minutes. I would recommend everyone to wait for 2-3 months to buy a certified 4.0+ Charger is released, instead of buying a Quick-charge 3.0 charger right now..
Pros:Strong performance for the priceClassy build qualityPure AndroidCons:Screen brightness low and adaptive setting way offNo NFC or headphone jackLimited availabilityKey Features5.99-inch 2160 x 1080 18:9 IPS LCD screenSnapdragon 660 octa-core 2.2GHz4GB RAM64GB of storage12MP + 20MP dual rear cameras20MP front camera3000mAh batteryFingerprint sensorVerdictThe Xiaomi Mi A2 is a phone that punches way above its weight. A few hardware shortfalls and limited availability drop it just short of an automatic recommendation, but this is deeply impressive stuff from Xiaomi.Why buy the Xiaomi Mi A2?Beyond performance this is a well-built, stylish (in a slightly derivative way) phone with a highly competent camera. The inclusion of stock Android 8.1 Oreo really completes that premium feel, and puts the Mi A2 beyond many of its affordable Chinese rivals.A couple of drawbacks prevent it from being an unequivocal recommendation, however. The Mi A2’s screen doesn’t get bright enough, and the lack of both NFC and a headphone jack are tough to swallow.Ultimately, though, the biggest downside to the Xiaomi Mi A2 is that it isn’t more widely available at the time of writing. If Xiaomi can really commit to a global launch of this range in future – and iron out those creases – it will be onto a winner..
nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc..
Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?.
Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times...

Great  phone by honor.
I like the phone very much...looks just like iPhone 10x.Very good clarity and the speed is awesome.. I was happy to see it delivered before time and well packed.The Honor8x is a great phone with very good specs..
waste of money don't buy  please.
This phone doesn't have any cons or defects according to harware specifications.Like battery doesn't drain fast, it last as 4000mAh battery should be. Display is 720p  so battery will last longer then other 4000mAh battery mobiles with 1080p display.If this phone had c-type then this phone would be much awesome. And every thing else is fine..
Don't buy this phone......fingerprint sensor not working properly...processor Woking slowly comper to other mi phones camera is very poor front and rear both bettory backup very good not excellent..
100%Over all performance and100% Battery life is too good in that price#awsm.75%Sound quality is nice.95%Display quality is also nice  BUT60%front camera is not good enough specially in indore light conditions,Lack of  image sharpness in captured image.89%Back camera is good but portrate mode is not working properly..Looking like artificially blured photo .its look like the depth sensor camera is only for show off or marketing purposes...  I hope HONOR will fix this camera issues by ota updates....
I bought this phone 7 days ago and I'm extremely happy with this phone.I'm glad I didn't chose Asus zenfone m1 Pro, I'm satisfied with honor 8c.Honor rocks really. I think honor company is as good as apple or maybe better..
I loved the item. I'm not into games and so the battery life stays up to 3 days with the battery saver mode on. Great display and music. Good storage. Sometimes the fingerprint reader doesn't work (1 in 20 scenarios) instead it asks for the pin. Apart from that, the camera and the new version are great. If you're looking for something within the budget then this is a great choice..
Pubg- in this phone I can play pubg flawlessly... Without facing any problem. Graphics settings whichever phone recommends that only we can apply...And I can play asphalt 9 flawlessly without disturbing the graphic settings.Face recognition is good under good light condition.... But in low light it is pathetic..
the product is good and simple but the cost is high.the only drawback I found in this mobile the is a plastic body and gorilla glass is not present.I didn't get receive the invoice with GST .so I think I could not claim the warranty..
Looks good picture quality good battery good gives value for money.
The device really works well than expected in this price segment however company needs to work on low light photos..
Gifted to my belovedOver all very good mobile got a very good exchange rate performance of the phone is good pictures quality is good sound quality good over very good product.
the mobile is just ok . Look and features are  not at par with the Asus Max Pro M1. which I have as stand by. not very elegant.  Good thing is the pack comes with a screen guard and a back cover..
Well after years of using Samsung redmi oppo vivo I'm tired of smartphones can promise I honour will not let u down I loved this product became a fan of hauwaei honour 8c.
Good performance and nice looking.
Very good performance.
Honor could have easily given a better screen resolution. Don't know why it kept a single setback in its product when the other features are remarkable..
Everything is good ... But it has shown the sign of sudden shut down in the time of accessing where the battery is full.  Getting scared ... Have not got the bill yet .....
This Mobile has continuous Hang problem.Specially with WhatsApp and Gallery.I tried to contact online Honor care also but have not got any soltion..
Picture quality is superb, battery is too good and so as sound quality..
good.

Great  phone by honor.
I like the phone very much...looks just like iPhone 10x.Very good clarity and the speed is awesome.. I was happy to see it delivered before time and well packed.The Honor8x is a great phone with very good specs..
waste of money don't buy  please.
This phone doesn't have any cons or defects according to harware specifications.Like battery doesn't drain fast, it last as 4000mAh battery should be. Display is 720p  so battery will last longer then other 4000mAh battery mobiles with 1080p display.If this phone had c-type then this phone would be much awesome. And every thing else is fine..
Don't buy this phone......fingerprint sensor not working properly...processor Woking slowly comper to other mi phones camera is very poor front and rear both bettory backup very good not excellent..
100%Over all performance and100% Battery life is too good in that price#awsm.75%Sound quality is nice.95%Display quality is also nice  BUT60%front camera is not good enough specially in indore light conditions,Lack of  image sharpness in captured image.89%Back camera is good but portrate mode is not working properly..Looking like artificially blured photo .its look like the depth sensor camera is only for show off or marketing purposes...  I hope HONOR will fix this camera issues by ota updates....
I bought this phone 7 days ago and I'm extremely happy with this phone.I'm glad I didn't chose Asus zenfone m1 Pro, I'm satisfied with honor 8c.Honor rocks really. I think honor company is as good as apple or maybe better..
I loved the item. I'm not into games and so the battery life stays up to 3 days with the battery saver mode on. Great display and music. Good storage. Sometimes the fingerprint reader doesn't work (1 in 20 scenarios) instead it asks for the pin. Apart from that, the camera and the new version are great. If you're looking for something within the budget then this is a great choice..
Pubg- in this phone I can play pubg flawlessly... Without facing any problem. Graphics settings whichever phone recommends that only we can apply...And I can play asphalt 9 flawlessly without disturbing the graphic settings.Face recognition is good under good light condition.... But in low light it is pathetic..

A silently launched masterpiece by Samsung. No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide "Double Tap" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant)..
This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units..
No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance.
Unbelievable product from Samsung, much confident now , with new interface like , one  UI, in display fingerprint sensor etc.
First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2. The excellent battery even with heavy games3. Games are running quite good specially PubGNot Recommended.
Great product....... nothing beats it ....  nothing better than this product .......  ui battery screen all good ... cant get better.
I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is "unnis-bees ka farak" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes..
Device heat too much during audio call or video call.
Camera or display are goodBut finger lock not success does not work properlyNetwork connectivity very bad.
Its really an amazing product from samsung.. brilliant display colour you will never get it in redmi note 7 pro.. worth for money..but i received an defective one.. has scratches in display which brings me mild attack because its new one but has scratches when i unbox. made a complaint waiting for resolution.verdict: Worth for Money only mobile and charger (they giving 15W fast charger)Didnt used yet because of display problem..I have seen some notes says, display problem may put fingerprint not to work so be caution.Headset coming along with device is really pathetic . i am purchasing so many samsung devices for past 9 years this is the worst headphone i received at this cost...
Phone is sexy, no doubt!Those who are buying  note7 pro will regret when they'll get this device in their hands.If you're comparing these devices just on the basis of "pubg", then don't  buy either of them.Pubg needs optimization, so instead buy a device with snapdragon 855 or something  like that. You will not notice but the gameplay is slow in almost all devices(You'll know this, when you will see the gameplay in some ios device).Apart from this I'm  mentioning some pros and cons of this device:Pros:1)No competition in terms of display quality(Orgasm XD)2)Battery effecient processor based on 10nm process (Equivalent or better than snapdragon's 660 soc)3)as a result, better battery life.4)Design is also a plus point of this device.5) Front camera and sound quality from speakers is excellent.6)comes with DolbyAtmos (for best audio from Headphones)7) It uses a different UI which Samsung is using on devices like Galaxy s10 and later.Cons:1)Back camera is not superb, it sometimes enhances the picture quality uneccesarily.2)you need to be careful when using inDisplay fingerprint scanner as it has fixed postition that requires your finger to be placed.3)No other cons I have found.Thankyou.
Samsung might have mistaken about the spec they offered. Camera megapixel might be 2.5mp but not 25mp. It has the worst camera quality.RAM Management is worst, it has got only 800mb available for the brand new phone for 4gb varient. I did a big mistake once again by believing samsung. They are simply cheating people with cheap tricks. I suggest dont go for it if you really have good camera sense.
Plz don't buy..slowest of the phonesSamsung alwz had this problem.
overall good but speed was not too good, processer was little creat a problem,otherwise excellent..every photo captured by selfie camera except  bottle...
I have only one word - Perfection at its best at cheap price..
Overall a good product and thanks Amazon for a quick delivery.Only thing I felt that was not up to the mark is the speed of in-display fingerprint and the Pro mode in camera doesn't  have fully manual settings.Can't complain much as you get a product worth about 30k in 20k.Also if anyone who found a good case and screen protector please comment below. I'm searching for one..
Worst finger print scannerNow after the usage number of things are not in sinkCons:1. Heating issue2.Fingerprint scanner dosent work properly3. Too bad processing speed. It takes time to open apps... lag in app search.4. Front Camera pictures are too soft.5. App starts too slow.. n app search is also too slowPros1. The display is good2. Back camera performs really good in low light.3. Games are running quite good specially PubG. but Sound is too low when playing PubG..
Waste of money to buy Samsung Galaxy A50 and suggest everyone not to buy the phone. In display finger scanner doesn't work properly. But sound quality and amoled display are superb..
This phone is not for those who are Xiaomi and Asus value for money mobile fans. Galaxy A50 is a for different class people who are sophisticated and need quality. This fone will never satisfy the customers who want everything in half price.According to me, there are few times when Samsung makes devices which are a class apart in their segment for example Galaxy J7 Pro. Likewise, Galaxy A50 is offered with highest possible standards of quality.Thanks Samsung!!.
In display finger print working slowly, phone also running slowly, built qwality good, but mobile not reached My expectations.
I was a Samsung user prev years used galaxy s duos and grand 2 and switched to Chinese brands cause of its features after long gap came to Samsung family the Galaxy A50 6gb variant.First of allSamsung is hearing customers reviewsLearnt from J series & on series  its mistakes....The product  #samsung A50 is excellent  as its Samsung  built is no compainanble....And ram management is smooth all apps are in memoryDisplay is top notch feels like a much costlier phone in hand feels light also ...Overall product is very good for daily usage and I got battery standby upto 22hrs in a chargeService network of Samsung in India goodOne ui need to get adjusted cause it's new... andIf u are looking for a phone and to use it for3-4years go for it....Update: I recieved 2 updates one for camera and one for UI and feels lightNot like old hanging Samsung ..its different andCan keep 10-13apps in memory and worth buying.
The best mobile u can get in this price range its feature loaded phone a premium phone can say wow.. tq Samsung for providing this product...in one word its marvelous fantastic awesome...nothing beats this.
It has almost all features of one plus 6t. I can compare it because my husband has one plus 6t. Well you have to compromise on few things like storage and CPU.  Rest you are getting everything at 18000 less price. A few reasons I went for this in the ocean of phones:1. Sar value is much less as compared to all othet brands2. Samsung goes on and on and on for years..3. Best at this priceRest you get everything which any other phones offer.1. featherlite touch2. beautiful display3. awesome camera4. thinner and lighter than 6tI noted few Cons: 1. 128 gb was not available in this varient.2. I can't feel the 4000 MAH battery backup.3. A bit of heating issue not much though to bother you at all.4. Charger is slower than my Samsung J7 2016 edition..
Samsung has delivered superb product... no other company can beat Samsung in its display quality...!!!However, onscreen finguretouch is slower in response. Battery drains faster but fast charging available... so no worries!Overall very good phone..
I am using this product since last one week. The phone is getting restarted everyday on it's own. It doesn't have any specific reason or time when it gets restarted. I found that there seems to be an issue with the device. I have raised a complaint with Amazon. They have arranged s technician visit . As i couldn't able to reproduce the issue at the time of technician visit, they declared that the device is working fine. But on the same day night, i have my device restarted. I am really not satisfied with the way that Amazon conclusion on issues that user reported on the items they purchase at amazon's site. The rating that I provide is specific to the device i purchased and for amazon customer satisfaction i give the rating 1 out of 5 . I am sorry amazon this what the rating that I can give for this particular purchase..
Before buying I had had a lot of confusions if I should really go for this product. Finally I decided to have it. And after using it for a week, I came to the conclusion that I have picked the best of the lot in this price range.* First of all, I must mention that I have never seen such a vibrant and sharp display, especially when night mode is on, in any phone in recent years. Front Camera placement is a beauty in this display. There is no gorrilla glass protection in this phone as per manufacturer details. But the scree is really hard to get rid off any scratches. I heard some youtubers saying that it has Gorrilla Glass 3 protection. I dont know the source of their claim. But what I noticed, the screen is really tough to get scratched. I am a happy customer.* User Interface in One UI comes loaded with lots of features including various modes of waking the screen. Such a customizable UI is really competitive nowadays.* Camera, both front and rear, is great and it is also loaded with lots of features. Set the photo resolution to 3:4H in both rear and front camera to capture 25mp shots and see the results. Also live focus mode, slowmotion and hyperlapse video features are great. You can use Open Camera to capture 4k video as well.* Always On Display cpmes with a multiple options as per user choice. I am impressed with the Tap to Show option in it.* Fingerprint scanner in Galaxy A50 is the feature that is much talked about since its release. But I think, after two consecutive OTA update, its now decently stable and works fine, though not like a charm. At least, I dont have any grudge regarding this as of now.* Face Unlock is also working fine, though I feel its less secure than the others not only in Galaxy A50, but in all phones in general.* Performance of Battery does not meet my expectations. I have used Galaxy On max with 5.7" display, Experience UI 9.5, Oreo 8.1 and 3300mah battery. It gave me much better back up than 4000 mah battery in Galaxy A50. I have closed all the animations, transition effects, marketting promotions in the settings. Still the battery performance is not up to the mark.* RAM management is absolutely remarkable. It keeps all open apps in memory which is really very helpful towards reopening those apps after a certain time.* I am not a gamer. So I cannot comment on the gaming experience in this phone.* Adaptive Fast charging is also a good thing in this phone. It takes about 1.50hrs to get fully charged. But I had to purchase a type C cable separately, for the one provided in the box was very small for me.* Sound quality of this phone is really impressive. Its quite loud for enjoying music and movies. Call clearity is also remarkable. It supports Dolby ATMOS, though when connected to headphone. So music and movies through headphone is of superior experience.* You can also use a tempered glass on the screen for extra protection. But do'nt forget to remove your old fingerprints and register the same after applying the glass protector once again to have a better experience with the fingerprint scanner.* Dedicated slot in the phone is an added advantage for me.* Finally, I may conclude that Galaxy A50 is a complete package in consideration of the demands of contemporary users like me, who cannot afford a high budget flagship phone, neither is happy with the china Craps that are sold in flash sale createing an artificial crysis, but dreams of having all the features in one single phone.* Guys, if you are also a midranger like me, just go for it..
On screen Fingerprint sensor...very slow response...most of the times doesn't respond...processing speed Is also slow...does not justify 6gb ram...however i think it's the processor which is actually exynos 7 series(not 9 series)..display is very good...unbeatable in this price range/..(fyi..Samsung has the best display technology in market..iPhones display are/were built by samsung)camera is very good..its a camera centric phone..games work fine..not recommended for heavy games..battery is good enough...lasts for a day or more with moderate use..people who have used devices with Qualcomm snapdragon processor..will notice the difference with overall functionality...looks wise expensive...built quality is good..it could have been an awesome phone if the processor/ram management had been upto the mark...overall it's a good phone...
Performance not Good, also having  heating issues....speakers are worst.. on screen fingerprint sensor is  not work most of times...except price nothing is good...Please think twice before purchasing this mobile....consult someone who is using this phone.
I bought this handset on 23rd march 2019 & out of nowhere a crack on the glass emerged on 2nd April 2019 ,Do NOT BUY model , the finger print is scanner extremely poor & face unlock is just an eye wash , it unlocks with your eyes closed also, my staff has a much low quality phone ie Honor 8 X even that dose not unlock with eyes closed.
I had ordered this product last month. It has a problem which will evade 90% customers. There is nothing wrong with the phone. When I switch on hotspot and connect to Amazon fire stick or my laptop and play a video the connection stops within 20 mins. Samsung inspection service came and gave their report. After that I got my refund. I again ordered the same set presuming that it was a one off hardware issue. The second set was delivered this week. To my surprise the second set had the same issue. I have ordered for an inspection which is scheduled for tomorrow.It is indeed shocking that a co like Samsung is selling products without proper quality checks.PLEASE DO NOT BY THIS SET. AMAZON WILL REFUND YOUR MONEY FOR SURE BUT IT WILL LAND YOU IN LOT OF INCONVENIENCE..
Adaptive brightness doesn't work fine, it keeps straining our eyes, u have to manually decrease the brightness...its really shame for the phone @20k..1) Finger print sensor is waste very slow...95/100 never recognize the fingerprint...face recognition is gud & so the pattern lock...2) phone is very slow , as compared to my earlier Moto G5S plus , Samsung one Ui is too dumb...at 20k u get 4+64gb...better to buy M30 , more economical...3) screen doesn't have Gorilla glass, back is glossy but prone to finger Mark's, U get a transparent cover along with phone..4) dont get lured by A50 luks,in YouTube...u have to apply the cover which is given with phone...it won't be same as attractive as it looks in those videos.5)Has that oppo-vivo like cheap front cam,making u look unnecessary fair&pinkish...6) I bought samsung only as it has low SAR levels...but if u check *#07# only head SAR is displayed...idk the reason...if u check body SAR online...its not less...So better check other cheaper phones with SNAPDRAGON and low Sar levels...NOT WORTH FOR 20K....
Worst product touch not working properly and heavy lag.
The screen does not seem to have gorilla glass it broke by just doing from knee height . The display s gone !.
This was first time when i purchased any phone online.And amazon didn't give me the phone's billBattery is not so good not so badCamera not so goodProcessor not so good not so badSometimes mobile gets heating problemFingerprint uselessFace recognition awesomeLook good3rd morning after getting this phone i got shocked when i saw my phone is dead and its still switched off.After couple of hours i managed to turn on..
Good one.....super.
I have been using this phone for 10 days and my feedback is - AMAZING phone from AMAZON of SAMSUNGSuper amoled screen is a treatI don't play games so,cant say about the processorFace recognition  is amazingBut fingerprint  is slowRest sound is amazingAnd battery is amazing tooOverall a jewel of Samsung.
Product is good in this price but some manufactured level hardware  drawbacks like fingerprint scanner, network issue.Might be more stylish like metic body, FM must be included,Wide angle camera is quite good.
Worst fingerprint sensor..it dnt scan fast.. N u want to retake 2 3 times.. Pictures are not that much good as they tell us 25 8 5 mp camera.. It overheated even i dnt play any game & n also the battery life is not good... It fisnish in 1 day even i dnt play games.. Just using social media .. Pls dnt buy.
very happy with the purchase, SAMSUNG did it this time in the mid-rangepors: 1. very good AMOLED screen..very bright2. very good battery, easily last 2 days for moderate use and 1 and 1/2 days for heavy usages.3. very good ONE UI, easy to navigate4. very good camera both back and selfie.5. new processor runs well without any issue.6. no issue with call services or receptions.cons: 1. The UI freeze sometimes which irritates.2. very disappointed with onscreen fingerprint scanner..at times it failed to recognize my fingers, also it takes much time to recognize.3. price a bit higher, 18000 would be better..
Overall performance of the phone is way better than other midrange series. I haven't played any games but the day to day multitasking is excellent and very minor lags are noticeable after a lot of usage. Battery pergormance is very good and with moderate usage I am still left with 30 % in the evening. Camera performance in low light is very nice even in absennce of a front flash. Fingerprint recognition ability is not up to the mark as compared to Mi phones. However there are no issues on this phone after 15 days of usage. Samsung lovers will not get disapointed using this phone..
Iam using this phone(4GB RAM variant) from past one week,  following are my likes and dislikes. I would personally don't recommend buying 4GB variant phone.  Likes:1. Display is very good at this price range2. Bluetooth output is good3. Call reception is good4. RAM management is very good,  I compared against some other phones, I can say Samsung has done a very good job. I an not seeing applications getting reloaded.5. Camera output is pretty sharp,  images are pretty good.6. Battery life is great,  It easily lasts one day with 100% charge. And the rate of charging is pretty good.Dislikes:1. Phone isn't very responsive, if you search anything in settings app,  for the first time it usually takes more than 3 seconds to search.2. We can easily notice lagginess in the app switch animation.  I have even tried stopping all animations to check the responsiveness,  but it didn't help.3. Speaker output is ain't great but we can manage.4. In past week I have seen screen freezing issue a few times.  All of a sudden facerecognition animation started showing at the bottom of the screen.5. Biggest disappointment is fingerprint scanner,  most of the times it won't work.  Whenever it works, it takes its own time(and it ain't consistent). I personally got frustrated with this unlocking mechanism,  I switched to face and pattern recognition.  I would have been happy if they had provided capacitive fingerprint scanner. Even after the recent update,  it didn't help much,  yes, now the rate of successful detection is high but still fails most of the times.To conclude,I was using MI 5(with Sd820) and it lasted for 3 years. I wanted another budget phone which can last 3 years(I don't wanted to buy mi), so went ahead with Samsung,  but looking at it's performance i can say it won't last for 3 years.  I personally wouldn't recommend buying this phone. Consider all the factors and make your decision, as we will be using it for at least 2-3 years..
Okay, So I have been using iPhone before and thought of moving to Android after much thought.After going back and forth for various ranges of phone, I decided to buy this. Here is my reviews after 2 days of using this phone:1. Battery : Almost full day even though you use extensively. Rating 9/10.2. UI Display : Just amazing. Rating  10/103. Device Look and handing in hand :  10/104. Processor/Performance: Works perfectly fine, not amazing. 9/105. Finger pinter sensor: It is terrible. 2/106. Face un-lock:  it works every time even in dark but not fast as one Plus.  8/107. Samsung UI : Just amazing except few common issues 9/109. Camera quality: In light its really good.. but at night or low light its terrible.Verdict:It is clearly not worth ~20K, but Samsung known for its display and good quality hardware. If you need the phone for basic uses like I do, it is really good. But you are passionate about Camera/Gaming. A big NO..
Overall the product is great...but one issue i am facing with my unit is frame drop in slow  motion videos.....i thought  it was software  issue but after upadting to the latest  software  the issue still remains  the same. Therefore  I want a replace of this handset. Please  look into itAttaching one slow motion clip for reference.Thank You.
The phone is very good...but I m facing heating issue... Whenever I use the device it's always Got heated.. and also the battery life is not that upto the mark... As they said earlier 4000mah battery we doesn't have to charge 2days or something even after continue use but it's not working in my phone as I had to charge it twice a day... and also fingerprint scaner is really very slow and maximum time it couldn't recognise fingerprint.  Please solve this issue or exchange my phone with new one..
Samsung well done as One UI is something which I never expected from Samsung. smooth operations, works like charm, till now didnt notice any lag anywhere like in playing games, surfing web, smooth as butter. sound is loud, dolby atmos shows the difference and samoled display is beautiful, in lcd panels every colour is mixed with backlight but in amoled if its red colour it is actually red, not mixed with backlight, that's why it looks saturated and punchy. if you dont like saturated colours you can control that, like I changed it to basic in settings. what I didn't like is camera, camera proved that megapixels doesn't tell about the quality  of camera, there's no RAW support so gcam wont work on it and in-display fingerprint sensor is sometimes slow sometimes fast. I am pretty sure that Samsung will be working on it..
The one mistake I did was buying the 4GB version instead of the 6GB type available at stores. Also, it wasn't available at the time of purchase. The phone looks cool, is feature rich and I loved the wide angle option in triple camera sensors. But having used phones like OnePlus 5 and POCO F1, I gotta say the phone is lagging at any places. For example, the call takes a second to load after pressing the button. Face recognition is snail paced compared to the one in POCO. The innovative inscreen fingerprint recognition is slower and sometimes does not read as well. In terms of gaming I play Pubg and it is choppy and slower. I thought Chinese Xiaomi had more bloatwares among all, but I was wrong till I used Samsung. I still have respect to OnePlus because of that. I haven't used high end Samsung phones and so I can't tell how it is in comparison with those phones. But this phone is a disappointment..
Let me tell you the review in few words:(Unbiased review | And I am not a Samsung Fanboy)In display fingerprint scanner is slow no doubt but no big deal as this is still a new technology, if you are comfortable with this trust this is almost a perfect smartphone...You compare RN7 Pro Or Poco F1But hey boy just keep these devices with a50 you will understand the significance *Why Brand Matters*Sleek Slim Not Super Fast But Fast Good Cameras good batteryYou Talk About Poco With 845 RN7 with 675 is Faster But Hey all this things just doesn't matter in real life Experience The Super Amoled Display Of Samsung Smartphone and You will Forget Poco choco admi redmi....
A awesome  phone by samsung .  Yes i M a Samsung  lover.. because it worth. Phone working so Smoothly. DISPLAY is Awesome. Camera  is good but need some update. It is samsung so expectation  is alwzs high. WHITE clr looks soo Buityfull . Battery is Awesome . Fast charging  is good but need to more Fast .NEW samsung One UI is Awesome.  It has most of the feature that A High Budget phone carry . Fornt camra is Awesome..
Previously i used Mi A1 ,I found this product from samsung is far better than the previous one.Like a coin has head &tail,this product has pros & cons as follows:PROS: Display looks good than oneplus 6,camera,user interface,lot of customizations,dolby atoms technology,Samsung health advisorCons: fingerprint slow,sound system,basic earphone has given but i expected bud type earphones...Worth for the cost.....
First of all let me tell you few things which I  wasnt completely sure before getting this phone, which I verified -a. Yes this phone works with international SIM cards. I have used it in US, Singapore and UAE. You have to initially run a call for 5 mins with an Indian SIM card in India though, which unlocks it. Weird process Samsung... u gotta thing something better.b. It has a built-in compass, so yes you will get a sense of direction relative to your position while using maps. I'm calling this out 'cos some big brands cut this feature out, which sucks.Pros:Great camera, both front and rear facing - its really good at this price pointSleek design - very slimStock android with no bloatwareGreat performance related to day to day use as well as gaming (see my notes in cons)Cons:1. On-screen fingerprint sensor. IMHO, Samsung just couldnt get this right. Its a hit or miss every time you try to unlock your phone. You need to really have your thumb or finger in a certain position and certain pressure for it to work. Really frustrating. I hope they can fix it through some firmware update.2. The glossy and flashy body. Personally, I  dont like any of the colors they have available. Its a fingerprint magnet. I'm using the plastic cover that comes with the phone which prevents the finger prints and gives a better grip. I wish they had some gradient color options and may be a matte finish version as well.3. After using it for a month, I'm noticing some lag in s ok me areas - while recieving an incoming call - it takes few seconds to show up on screen, search for apps does not return results dyanmically as you are typing... nothing big so far but would have expected these to be not the case for a brand like Samsung..
Pros : Nice screenStylish /Modern design /People may mistake it for a much higher end phoneSmall notchIncluded mobile cover in the boxCons :Poor loudspeakerPoor in display fingerprint sensorFingerprint magnetAverage cameraBelow average processorAverage battery life.
Slim and Fit in Pocket and stylish .It is arrived safely in nice packaged and it is fine though before there is heat problem but after hard reset and software update some how fix it . Nice and it is made of plastic body and screen in super vivid  and giving premium look. Camera is also good for capturing images in low light condition.User Friendly  Ui comes with Samsung one Ui in box pie.Speaker is nice . Dual volte support ..
Had the phone for a week now and am loving it.ProsIt looks great. Face recognition feature works wonderfully. I love the camera and all its features. Phone response time is good. Screen resolution is spot on.Haven't had any issues with battery just yet, has lasted me a day easily with a fair amount of social media, watching a few short videos, and calling usage.Says made for India on the box :)ConsFingerprint sensor is not great, have to try multiple times mostly. Too many unnecessary  preinstalled Samsung apps.Overall a great buy still..
Fingerprint sensor is quite slow and night mode is also missing in this device device in low light performance is not good for at  20k hope Samsung implement on it . overall a good device camera is superb both front and back daylight condition. Samsung has done much improved in there price and all sensors are also present. Super amoled display looks premium and feels like flagship.overall best phone for 20k ..
battery not charging as expected, 4 - 5 hour charging gives only 50 to 60 percentage of charge while heating is average(bit higher then normal usage) and sim tray socket internally damaged some noise came out from tray when we shake device, before or after sim inserted..
The best camera phone with in display fingerprint, go for it blindly..
Good looks but camera is average, low light conditions make camera even wrost, camera setting missing, one UI is bit laggy, not so fast compare to other budget phones.
Pros :1. Amazing Display2. Good Main Camera3. Battery life good4. Looks awesome too.Cons :1. Back side can get scratches easily.2. Wide angle camera is just ok amd only good in proper day light.3. Gesture and UI a little slow.4. Speaker is loud but quality is avarage.5. Both facial and fingerprint is slow to unlock the phone.This is my review after 3-4 days of usage.If I find anything else will post here..
its a nice and cute phone. it can handle every daily tasks.The camera and the One UI is not much optimized for this phone.But i feel no lags or hang till now .The fingerprint reader is very slow. The phone charges 100% with 1.5hr . the speaker is descent loud and crispy clear. the selfie camera is OK not a 25MP deal breaker. The Dolby Atmos Feature works only on Headsets. The sound Quality through a decent Headset is very good not much loud.The display is Excellent at this price point its much more sharp than the M30!! The battery holds up a 1.5 days if its used normally. call Quality is good iam using with the idea sim here in kerela and no problems regarding the cell reception and earpiece and speaker sound quality. The camera flash is not dual tone but the flash in this phone works pretty good. The gaming performance is OK no frame drops and all. the PUBG works in HDR! and the gaming experience was pretty good. there is no heating issue while gaming but its heats up during charging the phone. no physical notification LED. Overall its a great deal for this price range..
Fingerprint Sensor not working properly..
First I had problems with fingerprint sensor  and also the phone was a bit laggy.i had also updated the phone .then also the problem persisted.the onscreen fingerprint sensor was behaving weirdly, it was showing no match all the time.then when I did hard reset of the phone ,it became normal.the sensor is responding normally  and the phone is not lagging at all..
it has heating issue then normal while playing the game and while playing the game its touch issue  when you touch the screen slighty it shakes and  when  you open the map in pubg u cant mark the location you need touch 2 to 3 times and it has inacurate touch not a wise choiceto buy and the apps are slow when you open.
Good.
Been 24hrs and this phone is quite better than any Mi phone.
Display  is FantasicOne UI is very user friendlyCamera is above averageOn screen fingerprints scanner below average. Hope a software update will help it.Battery life is decent. 100 to 30 in 15hrs of normal usage  of gaming n youtubeing.Feels premium  in Hand. Go for M30, if u want to sacrifice the fingerprints scanner..
The good points about the cellphone are1)SAR value- 0.332)fast charging - 8% in every 10 minutes3)super amoled display4)User friendly Interface of one UI, just awesome5)Zero heating problem, even in sunlight remains normal6) Beautiful rear and back camera7)Very fast processing  and very rarely it lags that too for minor time8)Aesthetically very beautiful phone and gives the premium touchCons-1)Very poor fingerprint scanner although image scanner is quite goodThis is the only issue with this smartphone. HOPEFULLY  Samsung would fix it in forthcoming updates..
Very bad product1.  finger print sensor are not working properly2. Camera is bad indor , outdore & night photography is very bad click the photo and zoom the photo  you received blure photo no detail in photo3. Battery backup very bad4. Phone little slow 1 to 2 sec. Diley5. Good displayKoi bhi mat lo is phone ko warna lene ke baad pachtaoge ki kya phone le liya agar ye phone 12000 ka hota tab ye thik thaIs phone ka 25 megapixel ka camera kahi se bhi nahi lagta iss se badiya photo to 8 megapixel se aa jaati haiIss  se badiya photo to mere Asus zenfone max pro m1 me photo aate hai zoom karne par bhi blure nahi hoti.
It's a very good premium brand smartphone for a budget, packed with lots of features where competitors charge almost double for similar specs. The prosFantastic cameraGreat UIComes with android 9Value for moneyLooks sleek and not plastickyConsI used to use a moto z2 play earlier with a similar battery and it charged a lot faster and lasted almost 2 days, this one lasts a day but  this isnt inconvenientFinger print sensor is slightly slow - they released a patch to update it, it got faster but I'm expecting some more upgrades.
This is a smart device.But it is not a phone, as it cannot make calls.Two out of three calls fail.Passed the return window so I can't return it..
The phone is awesome. The display is top notch, especially if you are switching from a non-AMOLED display. Battery works great with 1.5 days of active usage. The camera is great. The only point worth frowning at is the fingerprint sensor, which is average. If you're looking for a phone with good specs and a trusted brand in the mid-range, go for it..
Very poor finger print sensor.. Display is good and camer could perform better with 25 mpx mode HRD is disabled.. which dose not make any sense as it has the hardware and processor to have HRD with 25 mpx, but Samsung is Samsung and they disabled it.. Haptic feedback is also disabled in this phone, which is another pain... I moved from Xiaomi only because of MIUI Adds, but I will again go back to Xiaomi if the MI A3 comes.....
Decent Performance For Mid Range Series. Camera isnt that great but is enough for average user.battery life is a killer feature 8hrs easy SOT. OneUI Pie. Overall its a decent device with at this price range..
Using this product for the past one month and was itching to review this product. I moved from one plus 5 to this and Samsung proved my choice to be wrong. Really this phone sucks. Camera is real bullshit. You can see the image blur with a minimal zoom. Samsung has come I to the budget segment however they have compromised on the quality aspects. Selling this mobile and going back to 1+ again..
Do not buy this, if you are a camera lover, this phone camera is worst than ever i am using any other phone.Better to go with redimi or some other brand. DO Not waste your money to buy samsung , i m very disappointed with the camera. If buy you dont have option to return the product only you can replace..
Fingerprint sensor is the biggest disappointment of this phone. It doesn't  work 7 out of 10 times. Even for 3 times when it recognizes your fingerprint,  it will take some 6-7 seconds overall to unlock phone. Samsung one Ui is not fit for this processor. App loading time is very high, and I can see very frequent lags and delays in this phone. RAM management, camera and screen are the only areas where I like this phone..
Camera is the best thing. Other than that processor is dead slow ,I bought 4gb ram but it acts like 2gb worst.Battery another one it's take 3 hours for full charge ..
I have been using it for a month now.Look wise phone is fabulous.Processor performance is pritty decent. So is its display.Camera performance is average.But real problem lies under the screen.. That is its fingerprint sensor. It takes like 3 seconds to recognise. Even in that around 50% of times it fails to recognise you. Samsung released its update also. but thats too did not make any difference. Which is pathetic!.
Masterpiece.
Redmi note 7 pro is much better than this.
Not the value for money.

Don't buy it even nowadays Samsung is coming like China mobile.
Worst fingerprint sensor ever.
A silently launched masterpiece by Samsung. No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide "Double Tap" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant)..
This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units..
No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance.
Unbelievable product from Samsung, much confident now , with new interface like , one  UI, in display fingerprint sensor etc.
First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2. The excellent battery even with heavy games3. Games are running quite good specially PubGNot Recommended.
Great product....... nothing beats it ....  nothing better than this product .......  ui battery screen all good ... cant get better.
I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is "unnis-bees ka farak" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes..
Device heat too much during audio call or video call.
Camera or display are goodBut finger lock not success does not work properlyNetwork connectivity very bad.
A silently launched masterpiece by Samsung. No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market.

It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide "Double Tap" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant)..
This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units..
No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance.
Unbelievable product from Samsung, much confident now , with new interface like , one  UI, in display fingerprint sensor etc.
First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2. The excellent battery even with heavy games3. Games are running quite good specially PubGNot Recommended.
Great product....... nothing beats it ....  nothing better than this product .......  ui battery screen all good ... cant get better.
I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is "unnis-bees ka farak" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes..
Device heat too much during audio call or video call.
Camera or display are goodBut finger lock not success does not work properlyNetwork connectivity very bad.

Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes..
Device heat too much during audio call or video call.
Camera or display are goodBut finger lock not success does not work properlyNetwork connectivity very bad.
The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too..
I got the product today .. i activated it and installed the samsung shop app as described in the terms and condition but It says offer not eligible for you ..
Got the phone on time (7th March 19 morning) and was very happy with your early delivery. The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward..
The product is pre-booked but shows no offer on same mobile number for Samsung earbuds..
1st day mobile is dead and service centre reopen phone but hang problem and slow processing also faced.
This is my first phone from samsung after apple x and this phone is great as compared to display quality and camera quality ..also has fast fingerprint BUT face recogintion is bit slower than iphone xI recommend to all to purchase as its worth for single penny.
Had pre-ordered and was waiting impatiently for it to get delivered. Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default "vibrant" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints. Sounds clean and clear. The supplied AKG earbuds are an added bonus.Design: Looks deservedly upmarket with the glass and metal body. For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far. Hopefully, Samsung will keep it updated with the latest software and security updates as I intend to hold on to it for a while. Will update with more findings as and when I come across them..
OTP verification does not work . i got the s10 and when i try to register the device to redeem my galaxy buds , it doesnt give me the option to redeem , but if i use a number not eligible for a redemtion it accepts and says not eligible for buds..
S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands..
Highly customizable, superb display, verstaile camera. All rounder! The best phone in the market.And guys for battery, I tried switching to wifi, it boosted the screen on time massively to 7 hours. Try it. For camera, turn off the beauty mode..
Face recognition works slow, screen quality is awesome. The most disappointing thing is that camers. It capture images in already edited mode. It turns everything tan to snowhite. I was really expecting the camers to beat iPhone's quality but it doesn't even compare to that. If you like to see your color as fair as possible you might like it..
This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade..
Simply amazing. Lighter than most phones of this size. Fingerprint scanner is fastest you can get on a glass screen..
Charger quality is not good and ear phones niot given that much quality is that mobile looking like 75000 rupees and given cheep quality.
All is good but somehow camera is disappointing.
Just bought it today at 9pm of 9th March from my friends mobile shop ...but after using it for 1 hour phone is stopped working it's not turning on not even charging I tried to reboot it how's my friend is telling me but it's not even showing me any single point on screen...it was my first Samsung phone but worked only for 1 hour worst experience ever ....
1.Do not remove the pre applied screen protector. It doesn't come in the way of the fingerprint sensor.2.Battery is ok. Basic to medium usage at least one and half days.3.Camera cutout can be removed like the "remove notch" option in one plus.4.if your hands are small you will still love this phone. Main reason is the screen size to view videos or games.5.if you play games like clash of kings or pubg the battery will last a few hours. As on any other similar segment phone.6.has live message / ar emojis7.company provided back case is best if you want to keep it light.(Hard plastic clear case)8.white colored akg headset with the box accessories.  Good for basic calling and music.9. Bixby button can be reassigned to another app.10. Camera quality is very nice. Both front and back.11. Hybrid slot for two sims or one sim and one memory card.12. The 5g doesn't have second sim option and no hrm sensor. So choose between the two..
The best Samsung. People having issues with pre-book offer. Wait for 3 days after activation, it will show up..
Very smooth and snappy ..... it feels comfortable and fits well, buy any version guys quality is superb. I bought the top model  1tb storage , 12 gb ramCeramic white. Wow...  Amazon delayed it over a month . Ordered 25th Feb it was showing in stock will reach you by 8 March.... I got it on 20th March. Struggling for the offer also it was supposed to be 2999 for ear buds ..... now for me it shows 4999. I'm disappointed..
HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It’s the best I have used so far and it’s the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It’s the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it’s a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn’t scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it’s not affecting the performance by any significant amount it’s just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don’t take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don’t think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition..
Phone is Excellent but battery life is not upto the mark.
Face Recognition & ultrasonic finger scanner very good.
Gets extremely heated up, whether the phone is on GPS , connected to bluetooth, in daylight one even cannot take the phone out because of excess heating. Even the technician who came to inspect, was unable to resolve the matter. I will suggest not to buy this S10+ handset..
Excellent display, good battery.Even with 8Gb RAM there are minor flickering.Camera effects one of the best in the market..
Right time to upgrade.Got my pre order offer will activated in 24 hrs.
10 out of 10. It's worth every penny!!!!!.
Excellent product..
Its totally worth of everything u pay for it.
Very very good.
Best picture quality.
Front look is very good but back look not good...
Theres few u cant neglect1. Camera 's low light performance2.face unlock not secure at allBut mainly to me Low light Sucks ....Fir bhi dil aagaya isspe yrr.....
Face recognition is very bad but other than than best mobile in the market.
Beast of a phone!.
It's a very handy phone but at the same time very delicate. Overall a nice buy. Amazon  shipping time was great as always..
Smart phone.
I have problem claiming the Samsung earpods. I bought them with the offer available along with Samsung Galaxy s10plus.
Need to improve facial recognition as phone even unlocks using a photo. Other than that it is superb.
Nice phone.
No regrets in buying this phone. This is a beast.
I didn't get the offered earbuds.
Battery power is not sufficient  for whole day.
Brilliant display quality..and good features.
My phone gets cut in 2 secs everytime I call.
Its good but could have been better..
The dream package..
Verdict: if not for its unexpectedly bad battery life, this was a perfect phone.Pros:1. Screen is the best, after all it's samsung's amoled, full screen with punch hole design is just beautiful.2. Camera is amazing, and wide shot lens actually delivers good results, and that super slo-mo is dope3. Historically Samsung has always been bad at custom UI with TouchWiz, but with ONE UI, this has changed, it is very functional now and looks much better.4. And the best thing is they still have 3.5mm jack, and they also provided AKG headphones with it.5. Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great for me, though it took sometime to get used to.5. Phone already comes with screen protector installed, and a case in package.Cons:1. Just one, they use Exynos processor in India and many other regions, which is a sucker at battery life. Its performance is great, but when you buy a 4000mah battery phone, you would expect it to live upto its battery size but this phone does not. If only they shipped the Snapdragon processor, I believe battery would have been much better and this would be a perfect value for money phone..
i purchased an Samsung galaxy S10 plus on amazon.in and i have decided not to purchase cell phones on amazon.in anymore. The handset was turned out to be defective and device got overheated within 5 mins of switching on the phone. The back of the phone and sides were overheated and when i called the customer service, they recommended the factory reset but did not help they simply asked to wait for 24 hours to see if the problem gets resolved. unfortunately amazon customer service does not respond about replacement or return even though the return/replacement was requested on the same day of receiving the device. worst experience ever..
The wonderful phon ever ...to gud display quality dynamic super amoled screen... powerful exnos 9820 chipset 8gb ram edge screen is so good.
Used the phone today first time after a full charge, battery lasted 12 hrs and am very disappointed, giving it a benefit of doubt due to the setup and configuration of multiple apps - will review this again later in the week to see if things have improved..
The best android  phone we can have in market.Many benefits.1. 73900 and if you have HDFC credit  card, 6000 cash back and 9 month no cost EMI. Which means effective price is 67900.2. Pre book offers gets ear buds or 46mm watch at 2999 or 9999.3. Wide angle lens is top notch.4. Screen brilliant5. Smooth UI.6. Better user experience and value for money when compared  to iPhone xs max which will cost about 1.1 lacs.Cons:No phone can be perfect1. Ultrasonic finger print works only if your skin have proper engraving else will not work fine. Personal experience as my palm skin is has peeled off in winter.2. Icon pack is really boring.3. Face recognition is not reliable.4. Battery  is ok, use in full HD and with always on in tap to see you will get 1 days battery. Battery charge improved after 3 charge cycle.5. No tempered glass facilities,  it won't work. Only white stone glass works which is very expensive  around 9K in India. Better to import it. Hope there will be screen protector available as the pre applied one is generating bubble post usage..
Bought it from a local store after exchanging my brilliant Note 9..Display is dull and colours are pale compared to note9Also camera performance  is sub par..photos come washed out and dull without any depth ..battery performamce is slightly better only plus point is its weight is less and overall form facter is smaller .. for the price paid  its a big down  hope they will improve it with a software upgrade...disappointed with over all  purchase..buy a s9 plus or a note9 instead..much better phones in comparison..used both..
It’s the one of flagship Phone from Samsung in 2019. My observation is as below:Pros:Looks gorgeous....Display is best in classFantastic screenBuild and design is very excellentIn day light, display is perfectUltrasonic fingerprint is a huge improvementThree cameras give amazing versatilityPhone perfectly fit in your palmSound quality is amazingConsBattery life isn’t as good as expectedFront Camera is not so impressedQuite expensiveWill keep you updating if anything more is observed…...
Every thing is ok but battery sucks.3 to 3.5 hrs on screen time.play pubg it will drain from 100 to 30 in just 1hr 30minuts.and it heats a lot hence its winter what happend to it in summer.
One of the best android phones out there with the best of all features however the battery life is barely 12 hours with 4 hours OST. Carrying a charger along always is a pain in itself.
This is the first time I am writing a review for a phone so I have no idea how to structure it. So let's see!1. Display:-One of the best displays you can get in the form factor of such small footprint. The stunning AMOLED display is so colour accurate that it can reproduce upwards of 50 million colours. The blacks are extremely dark and the pixels actually switch themselves off to save power and give a more detailed picture.10/102. Battery Life:-I got an unbelievable 9.5 hours of screen on time (screenshot provided) It has intelligent battery analysing software which involves AI to deliver optimum battery life.8.5/103. Performance:-The performance of this device is unmatched especially of you are getting the ceramic 512GB variant having the Exypnos Processor which is not as good as the Snapdragon processor but it is good enough to not notice the difference.8/104. Software:-The new One UI which comes with the all the bells and whistles of the Android 9 Pie. The security that Samsung Knox is offering is some next level security and the security offeed by Samsung Pass and Samsung Pay is very secure.7.5/105. Biometrics and Security:-The biometrics offered is futuristic and the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is something out of a Bond movie. The face unlock is pretty much useless as it is prove to be fooled by even a picture of your face.9/10 for the fingerprint scannerAnd6/10 for the face unlock6. Camera:-The camera is phenomenal. Look at the attached picture I took from my vacation. It looks so bright, properly exposed and even the colour accuracy is not that off. The dual aperture is great for night shots and the wide angle camera allows a lot of flexibility for taking good pictures.9.5/107. Final Verdict:-One of the best phones you can buy which out-performs a lot of phones in the market. It is well balanced and very nicely built. Quite light and durable if I might add.9/10 overall. Would highly recommend..
The phone is best in all aspects except its charging speed.Every new flagship phone supports fast charging. But this phone really takes 1 hr  50 mins to charge when we are not using the phone.  Whereas while using the phone it takes 2hr 30 mins to charge. All the other features of this phone are awesome.Super Amoled Display is awesome.Camera is awesome.Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works really well even if your hands are wet.Face Unlock has been degraded  due to punch hole display. But punch hole display really looks beautiful.Battery Capacity is very nice.  And  battery drain at night is about 2 percent which is very minimum .You must go for this flagship premium.
pre-order phone s10+ and also got  new samsung buds to offer on Rs.2999, it's an amazing upgrade for the previous s9+, not only display and performance but also good camera  quality and battery, appreciate what  Samsung did this product for early 2019..
Writing this review after using the phone for 1 month. I did not buy phone from Amazon but writing a review here. The looks of the phone are amazing and processor is super fast. Screen resolution is fantastic. Sound is loud. Camera quality is very good. Did not have any problem from the time I'am using it. Earphone sound quality is very bad. The quality of the earphones provided with the phone is not of a premium phone..
My friend Akash using this S10 Plus.I also used this phone for 2 days. Its the best phone I ever seen. Display like alive like floating everything.Colours are amazing.Just go for it without thinking if you have budget..
Whatever it is Samsung is famous in having software glitch. Thank you Samsung keep it up.By the way nice phone design..
The phone is good PUBG m is going like  spreading butter on it it's a very good and beast like phone.
Liked it such a good phone nice Cam nice storage good stuff cool phone I've ever seen liked it gud.
The best about this phone is display and the design..When you see this phone's display, you are gonna see a much difference in terms of quality and colors... It's way Way Much better than my XS..I just Love it using in my hands..Samsung.. You really did a great job This year....
This best flagship phone of 2019. Thumbs up to this model by Samsung. Its expensive though, but what can you expect for a flag ship phone.
Great smartphone, Thank you Samsung. Samsung Galaxy S10 plus is the pinnacle of innovation. The device is a great value for money..
I wan to free product for use i like this world best mobile samsung s10 plus the cameras best prosser is best for all user.
Excellent product but proximity sensor is not good. Also No iris scanner. Screen quality is excellent. But Note series is best.
Just got it today, will update soon as soon as possible! Looks stunning and One UI is better than old samsung style ui..
The phone looks very gorgeous or mujhe sabse accha uska power share laga osm phone and battery life bohot achhi hai phone katayi zeher hai.
I am starting a new youtube channel. If you give this s10 plus. I will update a unboxing and review of this product.
Hi Everyone,So I am using this phone for last 10 days at the time of writing this review and I am in a position to write a detailed review.So Samsung s10+ looks stunning without a doubt and is packed with the latest Samsung in-house Exynos 9820 octa-core processor with 8GB of ram which makes multitasking buttery smooth and now it can keep more apps in memory without refreshing (High-end games) them as it used to be in predecessors Samsung Flagship phones.Let's bifurcate this review and discuss every segment.1. Display - Just one word wow! The display is superb as always it is with Samsung flagships phones and they have maintained their legacy in S10 series also.The punch hole camera looks great and undoubtedly better than weird notches but still, it can distract you but if you are creative you can use it in a better way, check out the walle wallpaper in Images attached.2. Camera- The second important think about the phone is the camera. So it is packed with the triple camera set up at the back and dual camera setup at the front. So total 5 cameras are present on s10 plus (highest in s10 series ignoring the 5G version).The images are crisp from the main camera and I love the wide angle camera which captures 123-degree field of view, so now you can put more in the frame without moving an inch.I am not a great fan of the telephoto lens but it comes handy when you want to take close up short want to record videos.Although it has two front cameras but the depth-sensing camera is not of any great use at least of now as you can get the same shorts from s10 which has only 1 camera.The Front camera takes good images not great as it pre-apply filters and makes the skin tone brighter and washed out and bokeh mode or portrait mode is not that great. I think it can be solved using software update.It comes with different focus mode and I love colour point and spin mode the most, attached the image for the same and you will find the colour point in action in flower pic.It can record 4k at 60 frames per second which is great and also super slo-mo videos at 960 frames for 0.4 seconds though in 720p but is great.It needs a little bit improvement in front camera otherwise back cameras are great.3. Battery - I am really happy that they have placed a massive battery of 4100 mAh which can provide you at least full day of juice.The charging time through charger supplied with the box is around 100 minutes from 0 to 100% and also the reverse wireless charging works great and I am using my s10 plus to charge my s8 plus.4. Biometrics- The ultrasonic fingerprint is really fast and works even when your hands are wet. You can unlock your phone even when the screen is turned off. Although you need to build memory muscle to ensure that you are putting your finger or thumb at the right place.The Face recognition is also fast but not as secure as fingerprint and also I hate swipe up the lock screen similar to iPhone X.5.  UI and overall experience - The S10 plus comes with android pie topped with one UI out of the box which is cherry on the top. The One UI is designed for single hand user and I love the night mode so they have worked hard for this One UI, which can be seen also.So overall great phone and highly recommended if you can afford it.Also, the pre offers are coming out so if you have pre-booked the phone get your earbuds at 2,999 rupees only through registering on Samsung shop..
I am big fan of apple and never used any android device but when i saw S9 picture quality i decided to buy the next model and as soon as S10 launched i booked it. I like the phone very much. Its nice phone..
Only one word,  Power in hand.
the battery is poor . A flagship phone with a price tag of 73k the battery life is not good. it lasts for 1 day only . (2hours youtube ,1.5hrs calling , music about 2hrs . and no heavy games. I had to ecchange this phone once and still there is a very slight heating issue.Apart from this everthing is very very good. But you cant use any of those features because of battery.
Received the phone on very first day had done pre booking  and had sold my one plus 6t that was my biggest mistake the phone is class of piece no doubt  in camer only if company  says it has 4100 mah battery i do not trust  i get the feel of 3400 mah battery  on the phone and have charge my phone  twice and company is giving that old charger claiming it as a fast charger which  takes 1.45 minutes  to charge  a phone i am not comparing the phone with onle plus fast charger in some much of innovation of good phone company doesn't looks to go for more quick charging  and there just a change of a camera in the phone and 8 gb ram phone in which Samsung personal apps only occupy 4gb ram o find the phone very expensive and same old gadget as 8 plus only giving a smart watch or era plugs on a cheap price i think  it not preferable to buy this phone at this price.
Why to buy android with such price - Samsung galaxy phones will reduce price by 1/3 in few months and resell value is like Chinese phone. Phone will be unusable within 1 year with poor or no software update. Think before buy.
I ordered S10 plus from Samsung website and got the delivery with in 3 days. As I've prebooked it, I brought Galaxy Buds with the offer (As the Galaxy Watch has only only one color so chosen Buds).Coming to features:Face lock is pretty awesome. Unlocks within a second.But found a bit problem with the fingerprint lock. Need to press a little harder on the screen for little longer around 2-3 seconds.Camera is good. Though the beauty option is off, it still not shows exactly how we are (still adds little beauty to it).Object images are damn. I took a picture and it's like HDR picture downloaded from internet. LOL... Camera resolution and pixel density is awesome... It took almost 50MB for a picture.Battery is not up to mark. But we have medium and max power saver option. Thanks for them. My phone was still working in the same way when the battery was 1%. No lagging or anything.Performance and every other are nice. But heating a bit faster when you play high end games like injustice2 within an hour or two.AR emoji sucks. But it's GIFs are OK.Always on Display (AOD) is another thing to mention. It has hell number of options to choose. And I love it...Worth for every penny..
I bought it ( samsung s10 plus white color ) from hissar ( haryana ) at 65000/- ( 6000/- cashback ). I sold my samsung s9 plus mobile for s10 plus. Now I am very happy to purchase it. I liked it very much. There are many new features in it. Most of I  like ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on front of screen ,  its light weight & its lovely design..
Overall a great product bought from Samsung Cafe great service also redeemed the buds smoothly.The display is mind blowing. Sound with Dolby Atmos is nice. Battery life is best with the Always on Display turned off. Very smooth and fast performance..
Excellent, phone is excellent.Excellent, phone is excellentExcellent, phone is excellent.Excellent, phone is excellent.Excellent, phone is excellentExcellent, phone is excellent..
poor quality pone must go for iphone xs max in this budget , really poor quality pone this is hre.
Samsung galaxy s10 Plus is hands down beast of a phone.Best Display, Fastest Performance smartphone currently.Absolutely Great Camera, Specially low light shots.Powerful battery.This is the best Phone in the Market right now.Go for it..
UPDATE: Worst fingerprint reader ever ! Wish it had the optical scanner rather than this Shty ultrasonic. Takes a lot of effort to unlock the device and most of the time it says to press harder. Other than that you will have to moist yout finger everytime before unlocking if you have dry hands because ultrasonic scanner doesn’t detect dry skin.it has a gorgeous display and this time the front camera is great as compared to previous samsung phones. I used iphone X before but this phone looks way beautiful as compared to apple. The best of all its ‘manufactured in India ‘.. we even get a case in the box ..
Face recognition cannot be fooled by photos or videos of a person, but it can be fooled with closed eyes. Ultrasonic fingerprint reader is super fast and unlocks immediately if my finger is dry. The display is crisp and works wow in sunlight. Everything about the phone just blew me away except the selfies. Maybe a software upgrade will make the selfies appear less washed out..
One of the high rated and next generation phone. Excellent features and more friendly & adaptable unbeatable programs. Handy and high end cute smart phone. Most satisfied and proud to be a member in Samsung..
Pre-Book Offer is not eligible.
Happy for the before time delivery but the phone had a software glitch..

EXCELLENT PRODUCT FROM SAMSUNG- - Galaxy S10 +.
The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too..
I got the product today .. i activated it and installed the samsung shop app as described in the terms and condition but It says offer not eligible for you ..
Got the phone on time (7th March 19 morning) and was very happy with your early delivery. The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward..
The product is pre-booked but shows no offer on same mobile number for Samsung earbuds..
1st day mobile is dead and service centre reopen phone but hang problem and slow processing also faced.
This is my first phone from samsung after apple x and this phone is great as compared to display quality and camera quality ..also has fast fingerprint BUT face recogintion is bit slower than iphone xI recommend to all to purchase as its worth for single penny.
Had pre-ordered and was waiting impatiently for it to get delivered. Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default "vibrant" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints. Sounds clean and clear. The supplied AKG earbuds are an added bonus.Design: Looks deservedly upmarket with the glass and metal body. For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far. Hopefully, Samsung will keep it updated with the latest software and security updates as I intend to hold on to it for a while. Will update with more findings as and when I come across them..
OTP verification does not work . i got the s10 and when i try to register the device to redeem my galaxy buds , it doesnt give me the option to redeem , but if i use a number not eligible for a redemtion it accepts and says not eligible for buds..
S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands..
Highly customizable, superb display, verstaile camera. All rounder! The best phone in the market.And guys for battery, I tried switching to wifi, it boosted the screen on time massively to 7 hours. Try it. For camera, turn off the beauty mode..

For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far. Hopefully, Samsung will keep it updated with the latest software and security updates as I intend to hold on to it for a while. Will update with more findings as and when I come across them..
OTP verification does not work . i got the s10 and when i try to register the device to redeem my galaxy buds , it doesnt give me the option to redeem , but if i use a number not eligible for a redemtion it accepts and says not eligible for buds..
S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands..
Highly customizable, superb display, verstaile camera. All rounder! The best phone in the market.And guys for battery, I tried switching to wifi, it boosted the screen on time massively to 7 hours. Try it. For camera, turn off the beauty mode..
The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too..
I got the product today .. i activated it and installed the samsung shop app as described in the terms and condition but It says offer not eligible for you ..
Got the phone on time (7th March 19 morning) and was very happy with your early delivery. The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward..
The product is pre-booked but shows no offer on same mobile number for Samsung earbuds..
1st day mobile is dead and service centre reopen phone but hang problem and slow processing also faced.
This is my first phone from samsung after apple x and this phone is great as compared to display quality and camera quality ..also has fast fingerprint BUT face recogintion is bit slower than iphone xI recommend to all to purchase as its worth for single penny.
Had pre-ordered and was waiting impatiently for it to get delivered. Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default "vibrant" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints.

Seller please replace the batteries on those renewed phones like you used to do in a past.. then it will be 5 stars again..
I did like how it came,however the charger took long to charge. I charge it for two hours, yet I managed to get 24%. If this isn't the real charger I would like you send the or I'm sending the phone back..
I was a little concerned buying renewed and the price seemed too good to be true.

I've been using mine for a few weeks now and I wouldn't have been able to tell it wasn't brand new if it weren't for the packaging. Overall, this is great value and I can vouch for this supplier..

I love it! Exactly as described..
so far so god, working very well,.
Works great!  Bought two of these. Fast shipping. Thanks!.
Great phone.......
Like it. It was all new..
Small scratches and a bad charger.Everything else works..
Personal for myself.
Received item in 4 days. I can say it's brand new. So far working like new item. In a word I can say 100 star. Thank you..
I'm extremely happy with my purchase! This was a major upgrade for me upgrading from an iPhone Xr . I was seriously sick of iOS and missed my old experience on my Samsung S8 which broke and Ihad a deal on iPhone so was like "why not.." regretted that decision. Ever since they released the galaxy S10+ I've been earger to get my hands on it.The device I recieved was pre-packaged in a Amazon renewed unit box but seems to be BRAND NEW. You won't tell the difference if it was used, refurbished or open box new. The phone is incredible, extremely fast and snappy. Was extremely easy to setup too. Just signed into google account and instantly recovered my favorite layout and settings so it made the transition that much easier. The camera quality is fascinating. Beats the iPhones camera quality by miles. Can take low light photos very well and the 5 different cameras really make a photo taking experience that much better with so many different modes to play with. The battery life is extremely great! My iPhone would die in literally a half of my s10+ battery charge. And I tell ya, I really missed fast-charging! iPhone always took about 5 hours to charge. Which I hated so much. And it died so fast. While my new s10 I get a 10% to 100% fast charge in just a little over an hour. I couldn't be any happier honestly!  Especially for the price! It's a steal! Absolutely recommend this to anyone coming into the android market for a Samsung device..
It's only been just over 48 hours but so far it looks, feels, and operates like a brand new phone. I had one glitch yesterday a few times but it seems eradicated. Will update on battery life after more regular, less obsessive, new phone level of use..
I generally stay away from used cell phones, but the new prices on these are really expensive, and from reading how well these were looked over and having a sense of security knowing if something will go wrong it's backed up. When my cell phone came in the mail, I was excited, but when I looked at it at, I couldn't tell it was used at all (besides the off-brand accessories). No scratches whatsoever. It turned on and I was able to set everything up really easy. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now, and it's been flawless. It really changed my view on used cell phones..
Honestly, I had second thoughts before going for it. The earphones and the original charger may not be there. As an S10e user before switching, I should know. However, it's stuck on 4G and can't get LTE sadly. I did so much research to get that fixed but nothing worked, I'll admit it's on Samsung right there. Just hoping there's a fix for it hopefully..
Looks like Brand New, but.
Amazing,but.....
Non-oroginal packaging, but phone like new.
Awesome phone.
Perfect.

Want the best camera? Want a great looking screen? Want amazing battery life? Want great simple software? Yes exactly, that's why this phone is great for 99% of people. Now if all you care about is specs, just walk away, it's not a flagship, but you won't notice unless you're reading a specs sheet. If your just a regular phone user, takes some photos, watches some videos, strolls through social media pages, and does some emails and web browsing, this is the phone for you, save your money. Some more pros, Google photos back up is unlimited, 3 times the amount of cloud storage for free as apple, and they keep pictures completely separate. If you use any type of voice assistant, you'll love having a Google phone for the best assistant experience. Lots of Pixel only features, screen calling in the US is an amazing benifit. Also, if you want to switch from Apple, this is the phone to try it with..
I work in IT and know how to use phones fairly extensively. You should know one thing going into buying the Pixel 3a: it comes with Google's Pixel launcher, meaning that the interface that you're probably use to with other phones (Samsung, Xperia, iPhone, whatever else) is different here. It's a lot simpler to use, and keep in mind if you don't like it, you can download something different from the Play Store.Photos look excellent in my opinion (see my attached photo), navigating around the phone and apps works very quickly, and cell service (T-Mobile) has worked perfectly so far. The phone doesn't have much grip to it, so I recommend buying a case for it.Overall, great phone!.
This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price.Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack.Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included.I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it).However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices.I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer.I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful!Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!)New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together.Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal..
I've been using the 3a for just under a week and am just really happy with it. I'm not one to spend $1K on a flagship phone, but the camera is very important to me, which often is a problem in more budget-aimed phones. With the 3a, the camera quality is spectacular.They've also returned the headphone jack, something I hope to see more of. Either that, or twin USB-C ports.So far, I'd highly recommend this..
This is my 48- to 72-hour review.I bought this to replace a Moto G4 Play that had served me well but was on its second battery and occasionally locked up on me requiring me to remove the battery to reboot.As I had become a Moto fan thanks to my G4 Play, I was looking at the G7 Play and Power.  For a bit more, the G7 looked worth considering, then the Pixel 3a came out for the same price if you take the $100 gift card into account.  I read several reviews, and the better camera sold me.  I jumped in, taking the Amazon gift card offer over the Best Buy offer.The phone looks good, still fits in my pocket and I can easily use it with one hand.  The screen looks sharp and I really like the camera after a day or two of playing a little bit.  I still need to learn more about it. I LOVE the call screening feature which I'm not sure is Pixel specific or the operating system.I switched my service over Thursday night but needed a new, smaller SIM card which ATT gave me as I continued service with them.Friday, I was on the phone off and on throughout the day, mostly setting it up, adding my work email and calendar, etc.  I also took a walk around my campus with it, testing out the camera on about a dozen photos.  By the time I got home from work, the battery was down to 17 percent.  17!  I had read that this didn't have a great battery, but that it would get me through the day.  5pm won't cut it.So, what can you decide in one day?  I got up this morning, Saturday, and did some surfing, and played some online games.  Now, my game playing is limited to word puzzles and backgammon, not graphics-intensive games.  The battery, which was charged the night before, was down to 37 percent before noon.  I'm now very concerned about using this during an upcoming trip, or relying on it for work or travel.  I really like the phone, but this can't continue.  I may need to return it.  Is anyone else having battery problems like this.On the plus side, the included charger recharges the phone pretty quickly.  But I'm not going to have the time, or outlets, to keep charging it while playing tourist..
I've never spent more than $200 on average for a phone.  I paid the price with suspect quality, since I mainly bought new Android phones for that price range.  Every phone didn't last more than two years, most even started to have issues after a few months (i.e. GPS losing accuracy, charging slot losing contact, etc.)  Of course the OS never gets updated so you set yourself up to be hacked on an old, unpatched release.  The worst is the camera varying degrees of terrible.  So I bought a prepaid iPhone 6 about 1.5 years ago but you know how well iOS runs on old hardware and it will probably not make the jump to the next update.No matter how much I tried to convince myself, I just couldn't buy a new XR, even after I sold my DSLR (b/c I just never bring it with me no matter how good the pictures/lens is/was).  However, when Google launched this phone, my last international family trip convinced me that I need to jump at the chance - pictures you have forever, you want the best camera/phone to capture your experiences.  Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me.Ordering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time.  I got it in 2 days after Google announced it.  Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc.  Phone powered right up.  Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM.  Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs.  I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes.Phone is awesome.  I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things.  I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive.  Most importantly, the camera is awesome.  Photos are not blurry so far and super clear.  I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options.  I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it.  Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.)It seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable.  However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges.  I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself.  The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping.  Can't say it's worst, just different.  The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years.  I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that.  The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers.Very pleased so far (will update if that changes).  Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife.  She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them.Update after 1 monthBest phone I've ever had.  Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc.  I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time.  I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures.  Battery life is great.  I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times.  I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue.  I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though....
The Google Pixel 3a is not what I was expecting but in the very best way! I have used iPhones for a number of years. However when I recently wanted to upgrade my phone the iPhones on the market we're way out of my price range and I honestly didn't want to sign up for a plan having a monthly payment. I looked into many phones and decided on the Google Pixel 3a. I was surprised how it came with a transfer cable so I didn't loose any of my pictures or music from my old phon. How majority of the apps I had were added as well and all I had to do was sign in again. The camera works amazingly and I no longer have to worry about running out of room for my memories. While the layout and some of the applications are a bit different, I am now a convert! Goodbye Apple, Hello Google!.
When you use a pixel... It kind of spoils you. It's hard to use any other Android after that. Everything is always so smooth and polished. I've had every pixel since the first one and Google hit an absolute home run with this. You get everything you love about the pixel for a shockingly low price. I've had the 3a and 3a XL. Currently typing this from a purpleish XL and it's incredible. The screen is very comparable and even appears brighter than my friends 3 XL. Seriously just buy this phone. For the price it's the very definition of a no brainier!.
I bought two Pixel 3 phones both of which had intermittent call audio quality problems and incoming calls not coming in. At times the issue was so bad that even even Google tech support calls weren't getting through despite having a strong cell signal. After spending hours on the phone with Google tech support and exchanging phones, the problems continued. Google refused to stand behind their product and would not provide a refund as we had spent over 15 days going back and forth with them to try to fix the issues and they only honor refunds within 15 days. Mind you, my experience was with the Pixel 3 not Pixel 3a but if you want to take chances with this poor excuse for a phone manufacturer... go ahead..
This phone just blanked completely out. It just stop working .. I paid like 500 bucks for a broke phone..
Hands done, best camera phone at this price point, maybe at any price point. It's fast, a good size, and decent looking. Recommended!.
I have just received the Pixel 3A on June 7 and June 19th the phone broke and the screen is black. I am on a business trip out of town without a phone. How unreliable this phone is. I am wondering if it was even a NEW phone. It is such a hassle and very disappointed with the quality of merchandise I received..
Basically Pixel 3 lite version like how iphone XR si to iphone X or samsung Galexy s10e is to Samsung S10, but at a more affordable price.Here are the list of differences compared to the Pixel 3 (original).1. Camera.Best camera at this price pointSame rear facing camera. One of the best, if not the best smart phone cameras out there in the market.Camera hardware is toned down. If you use 3rd party camera apps you may not get HDR+Takes a few seconds longer for post processing to finish; not an issue unless you take multiple pictures in quick session then try compare themThere's no duel camera on the front. So no wide angle selfiesUnlimited storage at high quality with Google Photos to cloud for 3 years2. Plastic BodyDoesn't feel as preinum, but may not feel the urge to buy a case for it right away.3. Has a Headphone JackCan use wired headhphone on it with a 3.5mm headphone jack. No adapter needed.Has Bluetooth 5.0 for those who have switch over to wireless lifestyle.4. No Pixel BudsUnlike the original, does not come with Pixel Buds out of the box. Not even wired headset5. No Wireless Charging6. Longer Battery lifeHas larger battery and faster charge time than orginal7. No Front Facing Speaker.Instead speakers are on the bottom of the phone. Makes it less emesrive/loud when playing audio from device.8. No water resistanceCareful not dropping it in a pool or toiliet9. Has mid teir processer: Snapdragon 670 with 4GB RAM. Good enough for casual use. If you play a lot of mobile games or multitask with duel screens, you may see notice some slowdown if you're used to high end smart phones.10. More carriers selling phone. Original only sold at VerizonLike other Pixel, Google phones; it is an unlocked phone so can use it on any carrier.11. Missing 3rd micLower audio pickup and noise reduction12. Larger size physcially than Pixel 3 despite it having lower specs13. ScreenHas OLED screen vs LCD like the original, but not as bright.443ppi original vs 441ppi for 3aHas dragon trail glass vs gorillia glass. Both are different manufactures with different names. Durablity should be almost the same14. No facial regonition softwareMust use finger print sensor, number code or pattern.Finger print sensor is top notch and quick like all other Pixel phonesMisc info:Google Software. You get stock andriod and access to most frequent security and firmware updates from Google. Guarenteed 3 years updates according to GoogleStill get active edge- squeeze to activate Google AssistantOverall, I say very good budget phone if you want one of the best camera and first access to Andriod updates at an affordable price with some compromises. Very good value for what you get..
Received faulty Pixel 3a with 64GB Memory Cell Phone (Unlocked) - Purple-ish.Phone did not turn on or charge. Tried all the advised methods for forced reboot, but nothing worked. No sound, no light, nothing.Amazon support advised to call Google support. After 40min on the phone with Google support (international call) eventually only solution is to return the phone to Amazon for refund (basically from across the world) . Going to return it the next day after receiving. Sadly not a good experience..
I purchased this phone on Prime Day, received it 7/15. No one that i called could hear what I am saying. Contacted Amazon Support on 7/26. Amazon directed me to Google who referred me to a certified Google repair shop that is 1.5 hours from my home. 4 trips to this repair shop and two boards replaced and my Phone is worse now that it was before. Unable to make or receive calls and the Volume up button doesn't work. I do not know if the original issue was even fixed because I can't make a phone call. I already got rid of my old phone so I don't even have a spare. I just want a new phone!!!!!!!!!!.
The Google Pixel 3a is a great phone when it is on. The problem is that the phone will randomly turn off without any warning. Over the past two days, my phone has randomly turned off about 3 times. Google support will ask if you've updated your phone (I have) and tried a factory reset (I have). After that, the support team will conclude that it is a hardware issue. In short, avoid this phone if you need to receive texts, emails, or calls..
This phone is more expensive than a similar Samsung telephone--I thought it would be worth paying more to avoid a ton of craplets.  Well, I got the craplets anyway.  The launcher has a big bouncing search  bar that  you can not remove without installing more crap.  After setting up phone, google started spaming me with helpful suggestions about using my phone.  No way to unsubscribe from the many "one time" emails..
The sound quality is so bad. I was trying to watch a youtube video on this phone and the video sounded like it was slightly muffled. Along with that I'm holding the phone on it's side and I keep blocking the sound somehow so I move my hand and the sound sucks anyway because it just sucks in general. I never had another phone where the sound just gets blocked somehow when holding it on the side. Another thing it that the aspect ratio of the phone is weirdly long so the screen just looks weird to me. I'm not sure if I'm remembering this part correctly but the even the blue light filter sucked. It just goes from white to super yellow and no inbetween. Lastly this is probably just because I'm used to a large size phone instead of a regular one, but the text is so tiny. I went on reddit and was like holy is the text so small so I increased the text and then I could barely read any paragraphs because to make the text a reasonable size it took up so much space on the screen.I don't know if the camera is great or not I only tried it out in dim light..
Why would you buy this thing when there are sooo many better options out there for half the price.  All the marketing effort Google is throwing at this legacy hardware is starting to look like apple, and it is sad..
The life of the battery is longer than my old phone - very noticeably longer.  I hated spending as much money as I did, but I do love it.  My carrier was able to move 90% of my applications over and I am able to check my Ring doorbell now, instead of my old phone freezing up.  The photo quality is fabulous - quite incredible..
Super fast, great camera, best battery life. Alas UI stopped working occasionally and after a mild fall became very erractic. Reset the phone, still doesn't work consistently. Have to throw it away. Sadly I liked it so much and hate to hate it.  But if it stopped workng, no point loving it, isn't it?.
I love the size and shape of the phone as well as the weight. It fits well in my hands and was intuitive and easy to set up. I use my phone for just about everything these days and unfortunately, the 3a battery life leaves much to be expected.  I basically end up leaving the battery saver function on all day in order to try and save battery. I love all other fuctions, the fingerprint scan works well, the volume is good enough, the screen is beautiful and the camera is AWESOME.  I posted a pic of the full moon I took on the beach. Night Sight function made it look so clear its like a daytime shot of the sun! In my opinion the phone is worht the price thus far and im enjoying using it!.
I purchased this for my wife who's essential phone had an unfortunate date with a swimming pool. I upgrade my smartphone every 8-12 months so I'm no stranger to using different phones, ranging from Google phones like the galaxy nexus, to the Nexus 6p as well as a Galaxy Note 3 and lately I've been on a good run of oneplus phones.My wife likes to hang onto her phones and also wants a smaller form factor. The pixel 3a is a welcomed entry in the smartphone world. Even though I've never used a Pixel 3 I have used a pixel 1 and 2,and I can say this 3a feels as fast as those phones. Sometimes specs aren't the while story. Regardless if this doesn't have top specs or a 4k display it feels premium, it feels fast, it looks great, and the camera is top notch.If you are on a budget this should be your choice. Nothing else comes close to the 3a's quality for $399. Pure Android is a treat if you've ever esperienced a horrible UI like LG's or Samsung, then you are missing out on pure Android. 3 years of support promised from Google is perfect as most people will replace their phone every 18-24 months but if you want to hold on just a little longer, Google has you covered..
On paper, the specs of this phone seem subpar. But honestly, it doesn't really matter because when you have this phone in your hands, it's extremely fast and responsive. I'm guessing this is due to some very well done optimizations on google's part.The camera is the best camera I've ever had in an android phone. The finger print reader works without error as long as my finger is dry. I tried to use the finger print reader after I got rained on for a bit, and that was the only time that it didn't work. In terms of battery life, If I leave location on, it does last me the whole day unless I'm using it quite heavily. However, I can make the battery last all day under heavy use if I simply turn off the location/GPS when I'm not using it.The little extra things about the phone are awesome as well: I love that there can be a song playing somewhere, and then I can turn my phone screen on and the song name will be there at the bottom of the lock screen. The google assistant is also pretty awesome: I like being able to say "ok google, text [insert name] that I'm on my way".
To begin with my review is somehow biased because i love Google products! But still, i tried to put that fact aside as i was testing my pixel.When it comes to cellphones I believe we weight certain features differently, in my case is pretty simple: all I really care about is the camera, computing power and battery life.I'm a hobbyist photographer and i own a full frame camera but carrying it everywhere is a hassle, so i find it really convenient to have a decent camera always with me. Night sight is definitely impressive! The photos are always crisp and this camera is really versatile, specially when taking low light pictures. The camera is simple to use, there's no way to change settings such as shutter speed or iso but that's not a big problem for me.The battery life is great! I normally charge my phone every 2 days but i must say that the processing power is not great, I've had a few cases where the phone "freezes" for a few seconds but not quite often so it's not a deal breaker for me.Overall i would give this phone a 4.5 rating but I'm definitely satisfied with the camera so I'll go for the 5 stars!.
My old Pixel1 died - or rather the battery did, and well you cannot replace it without spending "half a phone" on it.  I don't think any phone is worth $1000+ so I was happy that Google offered the 3a which has plenty of capacity for what I use my phone for for a reasonable price.  I went from having 15-30 minutes of phone time on a full charge to days.The process of copying data over failed because the old phone could not keep a charge long enough for the process to complete. With the help of Google support, I did a phone restore from the cloud instead, but this does not include _all_ data/apps. So the process of migrating from old to new phone, even within Google's own systems, was far from optimal and successful. Google support was very helpful of at least getting an operational phone with 85-90% of all features installed.You just need patience - every app have to be downloaded, you have to re-authorize/authenticate everything - and if you like me use apps for OTP, you'll have to create all new keys.Feature wise I like the XL size better then the original size. The "press for google assistant" sucks and will soon be disabled. I love the finger-print authentication, I used that a lot on Pixel1 too and it's still easy to use. Camera works, even thought he google app for taking photos is getting worse.The driving-mode feature sorta worked on the old Pixel, but it's like it has all new life on Pixel3a. The only problem is that it's over aggressive. Sitting on a plane I had to constantly turn it off as we taxied to take off (airplane mode does not disable GPS). But in my car it's GREAT - I start playing podcasts, set my destination and as I drive out the garage the drive-app activates and now incoming calls are "restricted" and full hands-free works great. The old pixel, this was all a manual process - and it would get confused at times and refuse to stop podcasts when calls came in.Given my experience with the pixel1 I'm unsure of the longevity of this phone. It has the same design fault not giving you access to the battery without a lot of special tools or spending quite a lot of money to have someone else do it. The next battery failure will be the last one for Pixel - at least for me..
This phone upgraded my Galaxy s8 and I couldn't be happier! This absolutely makes me question buying $800+ phones in the future. Camera is spot on, fingerprint reader is in a superb location, especially when fitted with a phone case. This has the stepped down processor from the regular pixel, but for what I use the phone for, I honestly can't tell. Battery life is not as good as my s8 but it will still last me 1.5 days with solid usage. The touch screen quality and feedback are spot on as well. Overall, completely satisfied..
A lot of the budget smartphones have to sacrifice somewhere. Pretty much all of them will have sub-par cameras, decent at best displays, and of course loads of bloatware. This makes finding a nicely priced phone for my mother a bit of a challenge because she is always after the best camera with a nice display but couldn't care less about the specs. The Pixel 3a shakes things up by going against all other budget phones; it has identical camera quality to the flagship Pixel 3 (in other words, the gold standard) a full HD OLED display and absolutely no bloatware to find! Instead the Pixel 3a forgoes the flagship processor, and and what I like to call "XL cupholder add-ons" (features that no one would ever say no to, but aren't necessary in a phone), so no official IP rating, no wide angle selfie camera, no wireless charging or glass back, and only one of the stereo speakers is front facing. I myself would find myself gravitating more towards OnePlus phones where performance is prioritized over things like camera quality, but for my mother and most other people out there who just want a good camera and a beautiful display, there is no better phone!TL;DR best phone for anyone not absolutely obsessed with specs like me and uses their smartphone camera frequently (so 80% of the population).
I buy a new phone every year because I love new technology and trying new phones out. I will say that I absolutely love this phone! It has one of the best cameras on a phone at any price. Beautiful photos in almost any lighting. And some of the best portrait shots of any phone. As for the speed, it's as fast as I need it to be. For normal usage you won't even notice any delay over the most expensive phones. I've had excellent battery life and great reliability. One of the best phones you can buy right now for an amazingly low price! I highly recommend this phone. I got the XL and love the larger screen!.
It is hard for me to justify a huge phone screen or cost as I use a phone for calls, texts, photos, occasionally internet and never games or video. So when the 3a came out I bought one immediately. I love the finger sensor position, exactly where you need it with one hand. The speed, sound clarify, form factor etc are excellent. The camera, however, is beyond excellent and is straight up spectacular. Sharp, contrasty pictures with no fuss. With this phone I don't feel bad leaving my Canon at home. The ONLY thing that I don't like is that Androids don't stream to hearing aids with the ease of iPhones (I would need to buy a second device to hang around my neck using an Android). Other than this, which isn't important to most people, this phone is the best budget phone out there ($750 is not a budget phone). Very impressed..
I absolutely love this phone! Love the fingerprint security feature, night enhanced camera, "Google assistant "squeeze" feature and call screening features. An amazing high quality phone that is simple to use and easy to understand. Best phone I've ever had for a decent price. Skip the iPhone and get the pixel..
Not a fan of Apple...don't like how every other device uses USB-B except Apple, can't change default apps, then they came out w/ an update that made non-apple chargers not work...just seems like a sleazy company to me.  Loved my Galaxy S3, wasn't impressed w/ S5, upgraded to S7 a couple years later and pretty much hated it (slow, glitchy) and decided I was done w/ Samsung, if possible (Galaxy's and iPhones are the most popular so I figured maybe I was SOL).  Did a lot of research via Cnet, Google reviews, Amazon reviews and determined the Pixel 3a seemed like it was just as good if not better than S10+ and for $500ish less.  I really like Google Home and figured a Google phone would have to work extremely well with Android.  Figured I'd give it a shot.  Verdict:  I LOVE MY PIXEL 3a!!!  It starts up super quick, not slow or glitchy, I love the fingerprint reader on the upper back of the phone (where you naturally hold it), very well-designed & user friendly system, doesn't come loaded w/ a bunch of garbage apps you can't get rid of, you can squeeze the sides of the phone to open up google assistant, you can tilt the phone left and right to switch from front camera to back camera, the camera has so many features and the night sight is cool,  charges fast, batter lasts forever and I'm a heavy user.  So glad I made the switch..
As everyone says, the camera is the best.  The Night Sight is amazing.  Battery life is good, I used GPS for about 3 hours and the screen set at the max, only used about 35% of battery.  The phone is not lacking or slow for daily use such as email or some Youtubing and Facebooking.  Only thing is that it doesn't come with it's dedicated Gallery app, and uses Google Photo instead.  So I have to download a third party Gallery, not a big deal.  Make sure to get a good screen protector, seems the glass is not as strong and scratch resistant as the Gorilla glass..
Before the Pixel, I was using the Google Nexus 6P which worked well enough until it got stuck on a bootloop and rendered itself completely useless. I'm not 100% sure why I went ahead and bought another Google phone, but I guess I bought into the marketing that's this is Google's best budget phone. I was very skeptical because I did see that people had the same shutting off/boot-loop issues with the Pixel 3A too but I read so many great reviews about it that I went ahead for it.I received it yesterday, downloaded all my apps, got it up and running, and before even 24hrs it froze, and shut off. I'm incredibly frustrated that I just spent nearly $500 on something that I feel is going to be nothing but a headache. I already regret this purchase very much. I'm seeing myself forced to switch to iPhones despite the price..
The pixel doesn't have the ability to connect to familiar wifis like every other smart phone. So, if you connect it to your home, school, or work wifi and tell it to remember and always connect to that, it still won't. You have to manually reconnect each time. Many pixel users, including myself, are stuck with "connected, no internet" signal when the phone attempts to automatically connect. So instead of using WiFi, you're usually using your data.I'm not surprised. Google may be a big company, but they are still fairly new to phones so even basic softwares bugs and still persistent..
I had a note 9 and it broke so I got this and honestly I don't feel like I'm missing much. Of course it lacks the note taking features and wireless charging. I really miss Samsung pay but honestly all in all its a great phone especially for price. Nice screen good sound. Great tactile feedback. The call screening feature is great. Pictures look great. Although I miss a few things from the note 9 they definitely aren't worth the extra price for me. This phone works great..
Love this phone. Had an original Pixel and gave it up when I switched networks to avoid paying in full to take with me to AT&T. Really glad I went back to Pixel from Moto. Phone is light weight, holds a charge more than a full day for me with medium usage and you can't beat the camera on Pixel. People complain about the old snapdragon but I can't tell a difference. Comparing side by side to an s10 or Pixel 3 this phone opens apps alittle slower but once in the apps its just as fast. The screen is crisp, the phone is more than quick enough for the avg person and it's only $399.
Super easy set up and transferring.Battery life seems pretty good. It was already charged when I received it in the mail. I didn't have to charge it for 2 days. It warned me I had 20% of battery life left. It also gave a tentative time of when the battery would be dead. At 20% I still had 5 hrs. of battery life left.Easy transition from my Nexus 6. My Nexus had some features that this phone doesn't have yet but I was told there will be some updates rolling through this year.Could be slightly cheaper, but I still think this is an excellent phone to have purchased..
Coming from a failing pixel 1, I bought this for the familiarity and features. I see all the same faults here from the first pixel. Keyboard swipe fails daily and requires restart. Wifi also fails daily, leaving me connected to my router with no internet. Sometimes when receiving a text the app will freeze and require a lock and unlock to text back. I expect this phone to fail in the same way my pixel 1 did, crashing when receiving phone calls or texts.On the upside, camera is nice and snappy. Great quality photos..
- The OS is extremely smooth.- The camera is ridiculously amazing for a non-flagship device.- The fingerprint reader is insanely fast and in a good location on the back of the device.- The battery lasts throughout the entire day. I'm not a heavy phone user to be honest. I don't watch a lot of videos and I don't play any games at all on my device, however, all of my previous phones would need charged by 6 p.m. on a normal workday.I'm not to the point where I would feel comfortable paying $500+ for a device, however, all of the above are the most important things to me in a phone and the Pixel 3a met the mark for me. I'm extremely impressed with this device and I'm hoping to get at least a few years out of it. Also something that I find really cool about this phone is the squeeze feature. You can squeeze the sides of the bottom portion of the phone to bring up Google Assistant rather than using a voice command.At first I wasn't a huge fan of the Google search bar being fixed to the home screen, but i can use it to search my apps and other setting on my device. I enjoy this because I'm able to remove all icons from my home screen so that I can use widgets instead.For those specifically looking for carrier information. I am using this device on Metro by T-Mobile (MetroPCS). The service I receive with this device far exceeds my previous two devices - Samsung Galaxy S8 and Moto G5 Plus..
Where do I even start??? The camera is utterly amazing, it captures beautiful detail, I took some pictures of my dog for proof! :) My old iPhone wouldn't even last 1 hour and this lasts 1 day and a half if you're a phone addict like me haha, if you use it less it should last even longer. Never going back to Apple, I'm in love with this phone..
+ Great for normal everyday use.+ Adaptive battery is incredible with fast charging support. At normal use, able to last me from 6am to 1130pm with 15% left (Whatsapp, Calls, Spotify & Social apps. Also paired my Mi Band 3 throughout the day).+ Camera is amazing but there's noticeable delay in processing photos. Unlimited cloud storage at high quality.+ Loud stereo speakers.+ Headphone jack.+ Android One- Only wished 3a has more storage options. 64GB is too limited. (Plus, 12GB is already reserved for the Android system)- Stock UI/apps can be daunting: e.g. had to use favourites instead of speed dial, can't directly rotate when viewing photos in Google Photos.
Careful when buying these, mine was not Verizon compatible and had to return it even though the seller said it was. "Completely unlocked" does not mean it will work on US carriers. As far as the phone goes it's hands down the best $400 phone  on the market in 2019. The camera is amazing, battery life great and form factor perfect. As long as you get it here or from the manufacturer and not your carrier it comes with guaranteed three years of support. It's also easy to work on if it breaks..
I've had this phone for about a month and it's my second favorite smartphone I've owned so far. After coming from a Moto G6 and having a sizable amount of Amazon gift cards, I decided to splurge (for my budget, at least). I'm glad I made the purchase, and I think this will serve me well for at least 3 more years (I average about 2.5 years on my smartphones since 2010). Phone service and quality has been flawless so far for me on Google Fi.Pros:-The camera is excellent compared to what I've used before (Moto G6, Nexus 5, Galaxy S2, Galaxy S)-The battery life is very good for my needs and can easily last me all day on an overnight charge-Near-stock Android with top priority for new versions and updates-Excellent performance, but I don't play games on my phone-eSIM (was able to activate this without a physical SIM)-The fingerprint reader works great for me so far (compared to laptops I've used and my Moto G6)Cons or Potential Cons:-No wireless charging (this is mentioned in lots of reviews, not a surprise)-No face unlock option at the moment (I believed this was removed for not being very secure)-No notification LED (I miss this from my Nexus 5)-No micro SD slot (not a surprise, I don't think any Nexus or Pixel phones have had this)-There's no option to lock the screen with the fingerprint reader at the moment (I miss this from my Moto G6)-A bit expensive for my budget, but still a decent value for 2019If you liked Nexus phones or previous generations of Pixel phones, the Pixel 3a is a solid option in its price range. The near-stock Android experience for this phone is fantastic and it should get 3 years of support/software updates. By the time official support for this phone ends, online communities should have some solid custom ROM options for it..
The rear camera performance on the Google Pixel 3a XL matches that of the quality you find in the more expensive Google Pixel 3 XL. For selfies (front facing camera) however, do you lose that wide-angle lens, but it's still as sharp and provides excellent image quality. The rest of the device is simple and straightforward. Just wish it came with 128GB as a standard though..
I was excited to get this phone, especially for the photo quality. In that area I am impressed, but as a phone it is a dog. Whenever I talk to someone they can't hear me. My voice is garbled or it disappears all together. I have blown out the speakers, rebooted, pulled SIM card, etc, etc, etc. Nothing works. Although the rest of the Galaxy 3a is great, without a good phone the rest doesn't matter. I will probably sacrifice my photo quality for a better phone and go back to Samsung. Too bad Google..
This is my first Google phone, and boy am I glad I made the switch.  I did so much research before deciding on which new phone I would buy.  This thing checked off all of my boxes, and then some:PRICE- this is so huge, the perfect phone for me for under $400 (I got it on sale) People need to wake up! This is a huge bargin!Sexy design - purplish color way - CheckPerfect size - I wanted a phone with a nice big screen, but not a tablet sized like a lot of huge phones, this one is right in the middleLong battery life - I get anywhere from a full day to day and a half of useAmazing camera- same camera as Google's 1,000 phonePlastic back - I prefer this plastic back vs glass, I have shatter multiple S7s, S8's on their backGoogle Interface - I have a lot of Google products so I love their UIsOverall, I don't see myself every straying from Google phones, they make great quality phones..
Love this phone came from a Samsung s6 edge, but always had a ATT Active phones which are trash, had a S5,s6,S7,s8 once wet charge port damages or camera fogs up if falls on face digitizer breaks. Besides all thst phone is quick enough for me, battery life feels like an Active phone, no bloat ware, great rear camera, finger print reader is top notch, and have dropped it couples times with a case and rain got me one day when riding my bicycle but phone was ok..
I was on the fence, deciding between this and the OnePlus 6t. I went with the pixel because, obviously the camera, and the option to use Google fi.As far as I can tell, this phone is made to use with every single carrier. I'm a truck driver so that's important. I change often looking for the best coverage since I travel the country.Performance wise, it's fast. It has a 670 Snapdragon and 4gb ram which was the main reason I was considering the OnePlus 6t, since that phone stomps the A3 in pure performance, but since it's on stock Android and the hardware isn't bad by any means, it's performance is great. Snappy and responsive.No micro SD which really disappointed me but cloud storage for free. The plastic build is a plus for me as well. I use a case and screen protector but I'm still paranoid about glass phones. The plastic here is done well.I bought this along with the Fog Knitted case and it looks p cool..
Before I bought this pixel 3a I was an advid iPhone user. My last iPhone I had was the 6s. I have been using this phone now for about 2 months and I am really enjoying it. The camera is my favorite feature and the battery usually lasts over 8 hours for me with a fullcharge. I can honestly say that I am enjoying this phone. I do miss ios features like iMessage and FaceTime, but not worth the switch back for me. The operating system takes some getting used to but everything that I did on my old phone I am able to do with this pixel..
Worked great for about 2 weeks until the touch screen quit working. Never dropped or got wet. Factory reset to try to fix issue ended up just returning the phone..
Have been using this phone for a little over 3 weeks now and so far have not found it lacking. I deliberately left behind my camera (a Panasonic ZS-100) on my recent trip to Japan to see if it could take the place of a regular camera, and it did not disappoint. Night sight was especially a revelation-- I had results that rivaled a DSLR or mirrorless camera with a 1.8 prime lens wide open. Plus Google Maps and Translate were a godsend in navigating the subway system. I never felt lost as long as I had my Pixel. Battery life was decent, going as low as 25% after a full day using the camera and navigation apps. Always carried a powerbank just in case..
Well I've had this for a while now, i got this because of my needs, a good camera and because android and i switched from an iphone 8plus, the camera quality is amazing on the pixel, the oled screen is really impressive, since I've never seen an oled before, only down side is the chipset and ram management, it lags here and there, but not something you'll really notice, but the ram management is kinda bad, you'll leave an app and when you come back it has to load all over again but in my iphone itll be back where i left it but it's something you can get used to, You won't find a better phone for the price , and did i mention the camera? It's reason enough to spend 400 dollars on. But if you want a fast phone for gaming then something else would be better, i personally only game on a console..
After trying for 3 hours to activate the phone with Sprint/Amazon/Google customer service teams, it was determined that WiFi calling was not supported for the 3aXL by Sprint.  This is similar to not supporting texts since WiFi calling is a basic function for most phones/accounts.  Not sure who is to blame but the 'Sprint Compatibility' is oversold.  I reluctantly had to return the phone..
The loudspeaker and phone ring have stopped working within 2 months of usage . I genuinely thought its a good phone . As it was bought on Amazon (Google Store on Amazon) , Google has refused to replace it . Please do not buy this phone on Amazon . I was directed to UbreakIfix by Google support . They confirmed a hardware issue in the phone and alos several users have the same issue . It saddens me that a new phone has to be repaired ..
Phone is responsive not on flagship level but plenty good enough for all but the most egregious of smartphone users.  Camera is great with night signt standing on it's own as one of the most impressive displays of computational photography I have ever seen. My phone will take photos in lighting condition that my Canon T5 has no chance at all of resolving. Maybe leaving the T5's shutter open for a vast amount of time but impractical for most photography applications. The screen is nice and sharp with nice color and enough brightness for easy outdoor use as you would expect, and it goes low enough to use in the dark without being blinding. The speakers are exceptable not great, though is prefer both being front facing. Headphone jack including, thumbs up for that. Charging is quick and battery life for my uses get me though the day easily most days. Body of the phone is plastic and well made. I subscribe to the making a phone out of class being stupid camp and am happy this phone is my made from a more reasonable material. An added bonus being the phone is very lite so with a case on it it's less noticable in your pocket. This is a great device, and is everything the vast majority of people want and need in a smartphone for a great price. Lastly the phone will be supported and say up to date keeping your personal data more secure than other less diligent vendors. This phone might have a harder time with competition in other markes with the like or the one plus 7 and the like, but here in the US it's one of the best value propositions out there..
The most expensive phone I ever bought. That tells you I'm not into overpaying for phones.This one meets all my needs.I'm a heavy user, so I cannot rate battery life that great. Mine is at 50% by noon most days. But it does charge very fast.Cam is fine. Night mode gimmick is ok.I love the call screening feature, allowing you to reject spam.It also gives you a printout of any voicemails so you don't need to bother listening.The music chip isnt bad. I stream Bluetooth in the car.,I do recommend you download Audio Player Pro app for best quality.I don't care if its not waterproof. I'm not going swimming with it.I'll give its a year and move on.Good job, Google..
Had it a couple months now and love it. I'm an average phone user, so lots of social media, internet, YouTube, music. Pictures of everything. No more "Hey Google" the active edge is pretty cool. Battery is decent will get me through the better part of a day, quick charge is pretty good..
This phone is great, no complaints. The camera is unbelievable and the night vision pictures are really nice. Runs pure android as you would expect from a Google branded phone. There are plenty of reviews on this phone on the internet, so I won't get into super detail, but you can't go wrong with this phone..
I have only had android devices and always went on the cheap side. This one works markedly better and has great battery life while also charging fast. I don't use it much, but every aspect of it seems top notch. The camera is versatile and very easy to use..
I've given this phone a good many weeks before I gave my impressions. In most respects I find it speedy and the UI nice and fluid and well designed. Since android 10 it's even better. The finger print sensor is fast. The always on screen I find extremely useful. It's the best phone I've ever owned in fact, and I've had many.Here's the thing. One of the reasons for buying the 3A was the OLED screen. Made by Samsung. I wanted those inky blacks. And, this phone delivers that, but, the greys are very 'streaky'. That is when displaying a grey screen (which is often after Android 10 and black mode) there is a distinct dark vertical area to the right of the screen. It's very obvious, not just on low screen brightness. It's always been there, but in my early use of the phone I thought its was just an intentional gradient.It's not. The blacks are inky black, but the grays, even at high brightness, streak for about 1/4 of the right hand screen. It's VERY noticeable at low brightness.So, excellent phone in all other respects. Camera is brilliant. Speedy updates are great. Fast, slick. Solid bit of kit.But that screen is driving me absolutely nuts.If I could return it I would (and then buy another one. It's that good).
This is the best camera amongst all the phones in the market, good battery life, Nice display, call quality is good, Stereo audio is amazing overall it's a must buy under 500$ price tag.
No problems so far with the phone; seems nice, but nothing special. My problem is with Google Fi support. I bought this phone to replace the Moto G6 I send in under warranty repair. After a couple of weeks waiting for a replacement, I decided to buy a new phone (but not through Google Fi) and use the Moto G6 as a spare. Well, it has now been 3 months and a dozen or more interactions with Google's dysfunctional call center and I still haven't gotten a replacement phone, even though I am still paying them every month for it. Decided to switch to Cricket (ATT) and got a new G7 for free as part of the deal with no commitment. In  the end, I wasn't saving any money with Google Fi and the call quality was very poor compared to ATT. Should my Pixel have problems, at least I have some leverage with Amazon. Can't imagine they much like Google either. Don't be evil!.
Texting on this phone is horrific. The screen is to sensitive and your hand bumps the microphone symbol which interrupts your text or it hits the "p" button adding a p to whatever you're trying to type. It's honestly extremely frustrating. I wouldn't buy this phone again..
The phone itself is  5/5 stars, but Amazon's service was not so good.The phone was opened on arrival (eg. seals were broken). Fortunately, the contents was intact.Shipping took two more days than expected because UPS sucks and refused to make a second delivery attempt.As for the Pixel itself, it is a great phone. I love the fact that it will have the latest android every time and it has a headphone jack! The plastic back doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Besides, 99% of people use a case anyway. Having a glass or aluminum  back is pointless.Overall great phone, this is no nexus but it's up there..
broke after several weeks of light use (i hadn't even switched my sim card into it - i had only been using it around the house). the screen wekt completely black. the customer service is HORRIBLE. i've been trying for weeks to get a return label for a google repair order, and have yet to receive one that works. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE - GET LITERALLY ANY OTHER PHONE. not to mention the fact that the ux is horrible..
I absolutely love this phone coming from a former iPhone user. It's definitely worth the price on how smart this phone really is. Beautiful camera quality, simple layout, great battery, Google really put in so much work in this phone. Do your self a favor and give it a try..
At $399 this is a STEAL. It's light, Looks Very Nice especially in Just Black. And it's a functional, traditional no bull**** phone. Fast Charging? You got it, Great Camera? You got it, Smooth Interface? You got it. High Definition Crisp Screen? You got it.What are the downsides? Your not getting the latest and greatest like a Snapdragon 800 series chip which is only a big deal for enthusiasts. And for some reason people think it's too light and they prefer a high quality glass or titanium or metal construction. Oh, and there's no wireless charging. which might upset you, I guess.If your looking for a new phone that's fast, takes great pictures, is easy to carry with you, charges fast, lasts long, and is basically the most trusted sidekick you need with you 24/7 and a price that's hard to beat GET THIS PHONE! NOW! IT'S AWESOME!!.
I'm an elderly tech nerd. This phone is a good choice for me. I was able to set it up with Mint Mobile and I am a happy camper.
Good phone for the price. I have a pixel3XL and this one is for my wife. Very nice screen and doesn't feel cheap even with plastic back. Fast, good battery life and awesome camera. Came with fast charger but no earphone included..
It's a very nice phone for the price. I've not really noticed any slow down or issues in my daily usage. I've tested it with Cricket, T-mobile, and Visible Services and works great for them all. Camera is great too. Battery Life seems good some far, have the mobile hot spot on at work for about 8 hours. Plus getting the updates for android first is nice..
Not much to say. Works great out of the box. Been using it for months now and it's way faster than other android phones I've used at this price range. These days, phones at this price point are nearly non-existent, so I'm glad Google is producing a device for this section of the market.A perk of it being a google device is that it receives android system updates on a regular basis, which is crucial for security purposes, and welcome for performance / QoL reasons. The phone launched with Android 9, and they pushed an Android 10 system update as soon as it was out of beta. I am not sure if I should expect to be receiving whatever the next major android release is on this phone, but even this level of support is above and beyond what I've received from, say, Samsung. If I could go back and make the purchasing decision again, I would probably have gone with the 3a XL instead of the 3a..
I've been putting up with some fairly mid-quality phones for a while so coming into this phone was like fresh air after a week in a locker room. Battery life is fantastic; I still put it on to charge overnight but once I was away from home without a charger and I still had a charge in the morning. The camera is amazing. I take so many pictures of my dogs.  I like being able to use motion capture on the pic, exporting them as a GIF and uploading them to twitter. Night Sight is a game-changer for nights out and dim settings.  Unlocking my phone with my fingerprint is fast and fantastic.  I'm more than happy with this purchase..
Absolutely love this phone. Can get almost two days non-stop battery life with my typical use. At least a whole day for a higher user I would imagine. Best phone I've had for the money. Need an insurance plan though..
Given all the problems I've faced with Google's phones the past couple of years, I was extremely reluctant to buy this one.  My Google phones have never lasted more than 2 years before issues arose.  With my Nexus 5x, I only had it a little over a year before it started shutting on/off at random times, a common complaint from other users.  When Google decided to switch phone manufacturers, I told myself, "Maybe things will get better," but it turned out, only barely -- my Google Pixel only lasted a little over 2 years before the battery gave up.  I was able to get a refurbished one as a replacement under my Google store warranty, but it too exhibited battery drainage issues within 2-3 months.So why did I decide to get a Google Pixel 3a in spite of all these issues?  Well, first, I just couldn't find a better android than this one at this price point.  The camera, speed, and lack of bloatware -- it's just hard to give up luxuries such as these when you've been spoiled by pure android for so long.  Secondly, I liked Google Fi.  I barely use data since I'm always in a WiFi-connected building throughout the day, so Fi's pay-as-you-go data plan has helped me save a lot of money.  Family plans might be better at other places, but that wasn't a factor for me because I'm on an individual plan.  Third -- and this is why I ended up buying on Amazon rather than the Google Store or Best Buy -- Amazon was able to deliver this to me within one day!  I broke my phone on a Saturday night (trying to replace the battery with a DIY replacement kit I'd ordered online, if you must know), ordered this close Saturday night close to midnight, and found this on my door Sunday night at 7 pm.I am so grateful to Amazon for getting this to me before Monday morning!  I use my phone to complete multiple tasks at work, so if I'd had to wait longer, it wouldn't have been the end of the world but it would've been pretty disruptive to my workflow..
Search for a review on YouTube called "Pixel 3a XL wasn't made for you." It's a click-bait title where he actually recommends the phone very highly and I agree on all points..
I bought this as a gift for my better half, and it has proven to be quite a nice phone for the money.  I use a Pixel 3, and the 3a actually has better features to it, especially the headphone jack that the Pixel 3 lacks, and a more durable phone body.  The camera of course is superb and unrivaled by any other phone brand out there.  I always recommend a case; unfortunately there was no Ringke Fusion case available when I purchased the phone, but I have used them on all my other phones since the Nexus 4 and all of them still look like new..
My old phone was a Galaxy S8+ that was dropped one time too many. It was a couple of years old, admittedly, but my new Pixel 3a XL is a better phone in every respect. One thing that might not be much to everyone but I do a lot of business texting and the speech to text is so far superior to the S8 as to be in a different universe. It almost never makes a mistake.Although the Pixel's battery spec is in the same ballpark as the S8+, functionally it seems quite a bit more potent. My average day with the S8+ had me usually coming home with 25%-30% battery. I haven't taken the Pixel below 50% in a business day yet.The camera is REALLY good for a phone. Take that comment with a grain of salt since I'm a photographer and have a collection of lenses that costs $thousands each.I've got enough money to buy any phone I want but see no reason to spend more..
Ordered the Purple-ish phone.  The phone came, was easy to set up and synch with the old phone, and worked great with my T-Mobile sim-card.  Seems to work fine, but the phone that came was white.  I's OK, and I have a protective color on the back, but it seemed weird that I did not actually get what I ordered..
This is the economy version of Google Pixel 3. I have had it about two week. It is a good phone. My apps and everything slid right over from my old phone.  Battery life could be better, I may need to review what apps are draining the battery. It's weird the way your contact list and a person's phone number show up twice. It takes phenomenal pictures. The speakers are LOUD..
After about a month with this phone I decided it's too much trouble to keep. But I'll start with the pros. The battery life is pretty good, I forgot to charge it one night and it didn't die until 6 pm the next day. The camera is great of course. That's about it. My phone had a serious overheating problem, and considering the fact that I only usually have 3-4 apps open (chrome, messanger, sms, camera) and am always inside, it was an aggravating feature to deal with. Whenever it over heated, it would immediately end whatever call/video call I was in the middle of, and wouldn't let me make a call back on the phone or on messanger ("Call failed"). Whenever you have to get used to saying "Sorry, my phone..." you've got a problem. Another annoying thing was watching videos...I would turn the screen for full screen, and the video would only cover half of the phone screen. I would download photos and not be able to find them in the photo files. I'd markup photos and not be able to find the marked up versions (they weren't in any albums). Just several tiny things that kept piling on until I decided I wanted something better..
Fast phone with extra display length.  Great improvement over my Moto G5 plus which I always though was pretty good. You don't know what good is until you upgrade..
I have never purchased a phone online before. You do not have the actual help of setting it up nor help in using it properly. There are a few things I have no clue on how to fix or change. The camera is not what they were raving about. I hope maybe a settings change will help. The only reason I bought a Pixel phone was because the guys from Best Buy had them and told me they were the best while setting up my new internet equipment. Modem and router. Not sure I am sold on it. Good for a second phone..
I purchased this to replace an iPhone and the 3a did not disappoint. I carry a second phone for business and originally had a newer, expensive iPhone. I prefer Android over IOS so the switch welcomed. The phone is very responsive and smooth. The software is great. I use an Otterbox case and the phone is the perfect size for my use. I am looking forward to other Google phones as I am usually a Samsung user..
I love this phone. The photos are great, texting is easy, calls are clear. I think the return window should be more than 30 days. My phone just started acting up with software glitches. I believe that is the issue. Sometimes if I am on a call, finish the call, and press the end call button the screen does not register the touch. It will also randomly go from the vertical screen to the horizontal. There is something goofy going on. I have had a case and screen protector since the phone was purchased. It's a shame my shortened window of opportunity to exchange the product is closed. I won't buy another unlocked phone after this experience..
Love it Love it Love it. just upgraded to this from a Moto G5+. after a few minutes ive noticed a huge difference in performance.  great value for a $400 phone and with 3 year updates you cant beat that. wish it had wireless charging but oh well not a huge deal. yes it's plastic but it doesn't feel cheap. the speakers are louder then i thought..
Awesome phone.  High dollar performance without the "high dollar" part.The phone gets a great signal in places where my v20 didn't. The user manual says to completely charge and discharge the battery 3 times before charging as usual. It took 4 days with at least 8 hrs of screen on time each day to do that. Awesome battery life.Phone seems sturdy and has good screen sensitivity even thru a case with.a built-in screen protector. It response well to most any contact or gesture.I wish it didn't rotate on the home screen, but there's no way I've found to turn that off. Other than that, so far it's nearly perfect.Plus 3 years of updates!.
The pictures were wrong color. Too much yellow!Sound on phone call low to none.
I bought it after several years with low end Moto phones. It is a serious upgrade from Moto E4 and Moto G6,. The phone looks fancy. Very quick response. Nice features with strong integration with other Google Apps. The camera is unbelievable.The photos look better than real life..The only downside is battery. Goes down very fast with mild use. However, charging is quick..
I love the design and quality of the phone. I really thought this was going to be cheaply made because of the price but I'm glad I was wrong. Just in case someone is wondering as some Androids come with a case and headphones, this phone doesn't come with those. What you'll find in the box is the phone (duh), charger, USB adapter, instructions, and a little key thing to help you open the sim card holder.[Update]: I've had this phone for about two months now and the charger has already stopped working. I haven't done anything to it and it looks perfectly fine but, it won't charge my phone..
The perfect phone for 99% of people.
Great phone; my second Pixel!.

What The Package Contains + 2 month update.
Want the best camera? Want a great looking screen? Want amazing battery life? Want great simple software? Yes exactly, that's why this phone is great for 99% of people. Now if all you care about is specs, just walk away, it's not a flagship, but you won't notice unless you're reading a specs sheet. If your just a regular phone user, takes some photos, watches some videos, strolls through social media pages, and does some emails and web browsing, this is the phone for you, save your money. Some more pros, Google photos back up is unlimited, 3 times the amount of cloud storage for free as apple, and they keep pictures completely separate. If you use any type of voice assistant, you'll love having a Google phone for the best assistant experience. Lots of Pixel only features, screen calling in the US is an amazing benifit. Also, if you want to switch from Apple, this is the phone to try it with..
I work in IT and know how to use phones fairly extensively. You should know one thing going into buying the Pixel 3a: it comes with Google's Pixel launcher, meaning that the interface that you're probably use to with other phones (Samsung, Xperia, iPhone, whatever else) is different here. It's a lot simpler to use, and keep in mind if you don't like it, you can download something different from the Play Store.Photos look excellent in my opinion (see my attached photo), navigating around the phone and apps works very quickly, and cell service (T-Mobile) has worked perfectly so far. The phone doesn't have much grip to it, so I recommend buying a case for it.Overall, great phone!.
This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price.Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack.Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included.I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it).However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices.I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer.I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful!Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!)New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together.Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal..
I've been using the 3a for just under a week and am just really happy with it. I'm not one to spend $1K on a flagship phone, but the camera is very important to me, which often is a problem in more budget-aimed phones. With the 3a, the camera quality is spectacular.They've also returned the headphone jack, something I hope to see more of. Either that, or twin USB-C ports.So far, I'd highly recommend this..
This is my 48- to 72-hour review.I bought this to replace a Moto G4 Play that had served me well but was on its second battery and occasionally locked up on me requiring me to remove the battery to reboot.As I had become a Moto fan thanks to my G4 Play, I was looking at the G7 Play and Power.  For a bit more, the G7 looked worth considering, then the Pixel 3a came out for the same price if you take the $100 gift card into account.  I read several reviews, and the better camera sold me.  I jumped in, taking the Amazon gift card offer over the Best Buy offer.The phone looks good, still fits in my pocket and I can easily use it with one hand.  The screen looks sharp and I really like the camera after a day or two of playing a little bit.  I still need to learn more about it. I LOVE the call screening feature which I'm not sure is Pixel specific or the operating system.I switched my service over Thursday night but needed a new, smaller SIM card which ATT gave me as I continued service with them.Friday, I was on the phone off and on throughout the day, mostly setting it up, adding my work email and calendar, etc.  I also took a walk around my campus with it, testing out the camera on about a dozen photos.  By the time I got home from work, the battery was down to 17 percent.  17!  I had read that this didn't have a great battery, but that it would get me through the day.  5pm won't cut it.So, what can you decide in one day?  I got up this morning, Saturday, and did some surfing, and played some online games.  Now, my game playing is limited to word puzzles and backgammon, not graphics-intensive games.  The battery, which was charged the night before, was down to 37 percent before noon.  I'm now very concerned about using this during an upcoming trip, or relying on it for work or travel.  I really like the phone, but this can't continue.  I may need to return it.  Is anyone else having battery problems like this.On the plus side, the included charger recharges the phone pretty quickly.  But I'm not going to have the time, or outlets, to keep charging it while playing tourist..
I've never spent more than $200 on average for a phone.  I paid the price with suspect quality, since I mainly bought new Android phones for that price range.  Every phone didn't last more than two years, most even started to have issues after a few months (i.e. GPS losing accuracy, charging slot losing contact, etc.)  Of course the OS never gets updated so you set yourself up to be hacked on an old, unpatched release.  The worst is the camera varying degrees of terrible.  So I bought a prepaid iPhone 6 about 1.5 years ago but you know how well iOS runs on old hardware and it will probably not make the jump to the next update.No matter how much I tried to convince myself, I just couldn't buy a new XR, even after I sold my DSLR (b/c I just never bring it with me no matter how good the pictures/lens is/was).  However, when Google launched this phone, my last international family trip convinced me that I need to jump at the chance - pictures you have forever, you want the best camera/phone to capture your experiences.  Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me.Ordering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time.  I got it in 2 days after Google announced it.  Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc.  Phone powered right up.  Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM.  Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs.  I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes.Phone is awesome.  I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things.  I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive.  Most importantly, the camera is awesome.  Photos are not blurry so far and super clear.  I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options.  I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it.  Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.)It seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable.  However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges.  I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself.  The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping.  Can't say it's worst, just different.  The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years.  I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that.  The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers.Very pleased so far (will update if that changes).  Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife.  She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them.Update after 1 monthBest phone I've ever had.  Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc.  I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time.  I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures.  Battery life is great.  I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times.  I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue.  I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though....
The Google Pixel 3a is not what I was expecting but in the very best way! I have used iPhones for a number of years. However when I recently wanted to upgrade my phone the iPhones on the market we're way out of my price range and I honestly didn't want to sign up for a plan having a monthly payment. I looked into many phones and decided on the Google Pixel 3a. I was surprised how it came with a transfer cable so I didn't loose any of my pictures or music from my old phon. How majority of the apps I had were added as well and all I had to do was sign in again. The camera works amazingly and I no longer have to worry about running out of room for my memories. While the layout and some of the applications are a bit different, I am now a convert! Goodbye Apple, Hello Google!.
When you use a pixel... It kind of spoils you. It's hard to use any other Android after that. Everything is always so smooth and polished. I've had every pixel since the first one and Google hit an absolute home run with this. You get everything you love about the pixel for a shockingly low price. I've had the 3a and 3a XL. Currently typing this from a purpleish XL and it's incredible. The screen is very comparable and even appears brighter than my friends 3 XL. Seriously just buy this phone. For the price it's the very definition of a no brainier!.
I bought two Pixel 3 phones both of which had intermittent call audio quality problems and incoming calls not coming in. At times the issue was so bad that even even Google tech support calls weren't getting through despite having a strong cell signal. After spending hours on the phone with Google tech support and exchanging phones, the problems continued. Google refused to stand behind their product and would not provide a refund as we had spent over 15 days going back and forth with them to try to fix the issues and they only honor refunds within 15 days. Mind you, my experience was with the Pixel 3 not Pixel 3a but if you want to take chances with this poor excuse for a phone manufacturer... go ahead..
This phone just blanked completely out. It just stop working .. I paid like 500 bucks for a broke phone..
Want the best camera? Want a great looking screen? Want amazing battery life? Want great simple software? Yes exactly, that's why this phone is great for 99% of people. Now if all you care about is specs, just walk away, it's not a flagship, but you won't notice unless you're reading a specs sheet. If your just a regular phone user, takes some photos, watches some videos, strolls through social media pages, and does some emails and web browsing, this is the phone for you, save your money. Some more pros, Google photos back up is unlimited, 3 times the amount of cloud storage for free as apple, and they keep pictures completely separate. If you use any type of voice assistant, you'll love having a Google phone for the best assistant experience. Lots of Pixel only features, screen calling in the US is an amazing benifit. Also, if you want to switch from Apple, this is the phone to try it with..
I work in IT and know how to use phones fairly extensively. You should know one thing going into buying the Pixel 3a: it comes with Google's Pixel launcher, meaning that the interface that you're probably use to with other phones (Samsung, Xperia, iPhone, whatever else) is different here. It's a lot simpler to use, and keep in mind if you don't like it, you can download something different from the Play Store.Photos look excellent in my opinion (see my attached photo), navigating around the phone and apps works very quickly, and cell service (T-Mobile) has worked perfectly so far. The phone doesn't have much grip to it, so I recommend buying a case for it.Overall, great phone!.
This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price.Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack.Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included.I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it).However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices.I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer.I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful!Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!)New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together.Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal..
I've been using the 3a for just under a week and am just really happy with it. I'm not one to spend $1K on a flagship phone, but the camera is very important to me, which often is a problem in more budget-aimed phones. With the 3a, the camera quality is spectacular.They've also returned the headphone jack, something I hope to see more of. Either that, or twin USB-C ports.So far, I'd highly recommend this..
This is my 48- to 72-hour review.I bought this to replace a Moto G4 Play that had served me well but was on its second battery and occasionally locked up on me requiring me to remove the battery to reboot.As I had become a Moto fan thanks to my G4 Play, I was looking at the G7 Play and Power.  For a bit more, the G7 looked worth considering, then the Pixel 3a came out for the same price if you take the $100 gift card into account.  I read several reviews, and the better camera sold me.  I jumped in, taking the Amazon gift card offer over the Best Buy offer.The phone looks good, still fits in my pocket and I can easily use it with one hand.  The screen looks sharp and I really like the camera after a day or two of playing a little bit.  I still need to learn more about it. I LOVE the call screening feature which I'm not sure is Pixel specific or the operating system.I switched my service over Thursday night but needed a new, smaller SIM card which ATT gave me as I continued service with them.Friday, I was on the phone off and on throughout the day, mostly setting it up, adding my work email and calendar, etc.  I also took a walk around my campus with it, testing out the camera on about a dozen photos.  By the time I got home from work, the battery was down to 17 percent.  17!  I had read that this didn't have a great battery, but that it would get me through the day.  5pm won't cut it.So, what can you decide in one day?

I looked into many phones and decided on the Google Pixel 3a. I was surprised how it came with a transfer cable so I didn't loose any of my pictures or music from my old phon. How majority of the apps I had were added as well and all I had to do was sign in again. The camera works amazingly and I no longer have to worry about running out of room for my memories. While the layout and some of the applications are a bit different, I am now a convert! Goodbye Apple, Hello Google!.
When you use a pixel... It kind of spoils you. It's hard to use any other Android after that. Everything is always so smooth and polished. I've had every pixel since the first one and Google hit an absolute home run with this. You get everything you love about the pixel for a shockingly low price. I've had the 3a and 3a XL. Currently typing this from a purpleish XL and it's incredible. The screen is very comparable and even appears brighter than my friends 3 XL. Seriously just buy this phone. For the price it's the very definition of a no brainier!.
I bought two Pixel 3 phones both of which had intermittent call audio quality problems and incoming calls not coming in. At times the issue was so bad that even even Google tech support calls weren't getting through despite having a strong cell signal. After spending hours on the phone with Google tech support and exchanging phones, the problems continued. Google refused to stand behind their product and would not provide a refund as we had spent over 15 days going back and forth with them to try to fix the issues and they only honor refunds within 15 days. Mind you, my experience was with the Pixel 3 not Pixel 3a but if you want to take chances with this poor excuse for a phone manufacturer... go ahead..
This phone just blanked completely out. It just stop working .. I paid like 500 bucks for a broke phone..
Want the best camera? Want a great looking screen? Want amazing battery life? Want great simple software? Yes exactly, that's why this phone is great for 99% of people. Now if all you care about is specs, just walk away, it's not a flagship, but you won't notice unless you're reading a specs sheet. If your just a regular phone user, takes some photos, watches some videos, strolls through social media pages, and does some emails and web browsing, this is the phone for you, save your money. Some more pros, Google photos back up is unlimited, 3 times the amount of cloud storage for free as apple, and they keep pictures completely separate. If you use any type of voice assistant, you'll love having a Google phone for the best assistant experience. Lots of Pixel only features, screen calling in the US is an amazing benifit. Also, if you want to switch from Apple, this is the phone to try it with..
I work in IT and know how to use phones fairly extensively. You should know one thing going into buying the Pixel 3a: it comes with Google's Pixel launcher, meaning that the interface that you're probably use to with other phones (Samsung, Xperia, iPhone, whatever else) is different here. It's a lot simpler to use, and keep in mind if you don't like it, you can download something different from the Play Store.Photos look excellent in my opinion (see my attached photo), navigating around the phone and apps works very quickly, and cell service (T-Mobile) has worked perfectly so far. The phone doesn't have much grip to it, so I recommend buying a case for it.Overall, great phone!.
This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price.Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack.Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included.I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it).However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices.I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer.I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful!Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!)New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together.Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal..
I've been using the 3a for just under a week and am just really happy with it. I'm not one to spend $1K on a flagship phone, but the camera is very important to me, which often is a problem in more budget-aimed phones. With the 3a, the camera quality is spectacular.They've also returned the headphone jack, something I hope to see more of. Either that, or twin USB-C ports.So far, I'd highly recommend this..
This is my 48- to 72-hour review.I bought this to replace a Moto G4 Play that had served me well but was on its second battery and occasionally locked up on me requiring me to remove the battery to reboot.As I had become a Moto fan thanks to my G4 Play, I was looking at the G7 Play and Power.  For a bit more, the G7 looked worth considering, then the Pixel 3a came out for the same price if you take the $100 gift card into account.  I read several reviews, and the better camera sold me.  I jumped in, taking the Amazon gift card offer over the Best Buy offer.The phone looks good, still fits in my pocket and I can easily use it with one hand.  The screen looks sharp and I really like the camera after a day or two of playing a little bit.  I still need to learn more about it. I LOVE the call screening feature which I'm not sure is Pixel specific or the operating system.I switched my service over Thursday night but needed a new, smaller SIM card which ATT gave me as I continued service with them.Friday, I was on the phone off and on throughout the day, mostly setting it up, adding my work email and calendar, etc.  I also took a walk around my campus with it, testing out the camera on about a dozen photos.  By the time I got home from work, the battery was down to 17 percent.  17!  I had read that this didn't have a great battery, but that it would get me through the day.  5pm won't cut it.So, what can you decide in one day?  I got up this morning, Saturday, and did some surfing, and played some online games.  Now, my game playing is limited to word puzzles and backgammon, not graphics-intensive games.  The battery, which was charged the night before, was down to 37 percent before noon.  I'm now very concerned about using this during an upcoming trip, or relying on it for work or travel.  I really like the phone, but this can't continue.  I may need to return it.  Is anyone else having battery problems like this.On the plus side, the included charger recharges the phone pretty quickly.  But I'm not going to have the time, or outlets, to keep charging it while playing tourist..
I've never spent more than $200 on average for a phone.  I paid the price with suspect quality, since I mainly bought new Android phones for that price range.  Every phone didn't last more than two years, most even started to have issues after a few months (i.e. GPS losing accuracy, charging slot losing contact, etc.)  Of course the OS never gets updated so you set yourself up to be hacked on an old, unpatched release.  The worst is the camera varying degrees of terrible.  So I bought a prepaid iPhone 6 about 1.5 years ago but you know how well iOS runs on old hardware and it will probably not make the jump to the next update.No matter how much I tried to convince myself, I just couldn't buy a new XR, even after I sold my DSLR (b/c I just never bring it with me no matter how good the pictures/lens is/was).  However, when Google launched this phone, my last international family trip convinced me that I need to jump at the chance - pictures you have forever, you want the best camera/phone to capture your experiences.  Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me.Ordering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time.  I got it in 2 days after Google announced it.  Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc.  Phone powered right up.  Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM.  Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs.  I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes.Phone is awesome.  I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things.  I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive.  Most importantly, the camera is awesome.  Photos are not blurry so far and super clear.  I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options.  I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it.  Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.)It seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable.  However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges.  I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself.  The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping.  Can't say it's worst, just different.  The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years.  I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that.  The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers.Very pleased so far (will update if that changes).  Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife.  She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them.Update after 1 monthBest phone I've ever had.  Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc.  I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time.  I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures.  Battery life is great.  I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times.  I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue.  I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though....

I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer.I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful!Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!)New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together.Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal..
I've been using the 3a for just under a week and am just really happy with it. I'm not one to spend $1K on a flagship phone, but the camera is very important to me, which often is a problem in more budget-aimed phones. With the 3a, the camera quality is spectacular.They've also returned the headphone jack, something I hope to see more of. Either that, or twin USB-C ports.So far, I'd highly recommend this..
This is my 48- to 72-hour review.I bought this to replace a Moto G4 Play that had served me well but was on its second battery and occasionally locked up on me requiring me to remove the battery to reboot.As I had become a Moto fan thanks to my G4 Play, I was looking at the G7 Play and Power.  For a bit more, the G7 looked worth considering, then the Pixel 3a came out for the same price if you take the $100 gift card into account.  I read several reviews, and the better camera sold me.  I jumped in, taking the Amazon gift card offer over the Best Buy offer.The phone looks good, still fits in my pocket and I can easily use it with one hand.  The screen looks sharp and I really like the camera after a day or two of playing a little bit.  I still need to learn more about it. I LOVE the call screening feature which I'm not sure is Pixel specific or the operating system.I switched my service over Thursday night but needed a new, smaller SIM card which ATT gave me as I continued service with them.Friday, I was on the phone off and on throughout the day, mostly setting it up, adding my work email and calendar, etc.  I also took a walk around my campus with it, testing out the camera on about a dozen photos.  By the time I got home from work, the battery was down to 17 percent.  17!  I had read that this didn't have a great battery, but that it would get me through the day.  5pm won't cut it.So, what can you decide in one day?  I got up this morning, Saturday, and did some surfing, and played some online games.  Now, my game playing is limited to word puzzles and backgammon, not graphics-intensive games.  The battery, which was charged the night before, was down to 37 percent before noon.  I'm now very concerned about using this during an upcoming trip, or relying on it for work or travel.  I really like the phone, but this can't continue.  I may need to return it.  Is anyone else having battery problems like this.On the plus side, the included charger recharges the phone pretty quickly.  But I'm not going to have the time, or outlets, to keep charging it while playing tourist..
I've never spent more than $200 on average for a phone.  I paid the price with suspect quality, since I mainly bought new Android phones for that price range.  Every phone didn't last more than two years, most even started to have issues after a few months (i.e. GPS losing accuracy, charging slot losing contact, etc.)  Of course the OS never gets updated so you set yourself up to be hacked on an old, unpatched release.  The worst is the camera varying degrees of terrible.  So I bought a prepaid iPhone 6 about 1.5 years ago but you know how well iOS runs on old hardware and it will probably not make the jump to the next update.No matter how much I tried to convince myself, I just couldn't buy a new XR, even after I sold my DSLR (b/c I just never bring it with me no matter how good the pictures/lens is/was).  However, when Google launched this phone, my last international family trip convinced me that I need to jump at the chance - pictures you have forever, you want the best camera/phone to capture your experiences.  Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me.Ordering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time.  I got it in 2 days after Google announced it.  Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc.  Phone powered right up.  Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM.  Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs.  I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes.Phone is awesome.  I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things.  I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive.  Most importantly, the camera is awesome.  Photos are not blurry so far and super clear.  I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options.  I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it.  Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.)It seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable.  However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges.  I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself.  The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping.  Can't say it's worst, just different.  The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years.  I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that.  The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers.Very pleased so far (will update if that changes).  Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife.  She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them.Update after 1 monthBest phone I've ever had.  Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc.  I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time.  I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures.  Battery life is great.  I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times.  I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue.  I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though....
The Google Pixel 3a is not what I was expecting but in the very best way! I have used iPhones for a number of years. However when I recently wanted to upgrade my phone the iPhones on the market we're way out of my price range and I honestly didn't want to sign up for a plan having a monthly payment. I looked into many phones and decided on the Google Pixel 3a. I was surprised how it came with a transfer cable so I didn't loose any of my pictures or music from my old phon. How majority of the apps I had were added as well and all I had to do was sign in again. The camera works amazingly and I no longer have to worry about running out of room for my memories. While the layout and some of the applications are a bit different, I am now a convert! Goodbye Apple, Hello Google!.
When you use a pixel... It kind of spoils you. It's hard to use any other Android after that. Everything is always so smooth and polished. I've had every pixel since the first one and Google hit an absolute home run with this. You get everything you love about the pixel for a shockingly low price. I've had the 3a and 3a XL. Currently typing this from a purpleish XL and it's incredible. The screen is very comparable and even appears brighter than my friends 3 XL. Seriously just buy this phone. For the price it's the very definition of a no brainier!.
I bought two Pixel 3 phones both of which had intermittent call audio quality problems and incoming calls not coming in. At times the issue was so bad that even even Google tech support calls weren't getting through despite having a strong cell signal. After spending hours on the phone with Google tech support and exchanging phones, the problems continued. Google refused to stand behind their product and would not provide a refund as we had spent over 15 days going back and forth with them to try to fix the issues and they only honor refunds within 15 days. Mind you, my experience was with the Pixel 3 not Pixel 3a but if you want to take chances with this poor excuse for a phone manufacturer... go ahead..
This phone just blanked completely out. It just stop working .. I paid like 500 bucks for a broke phone..
Want the best camera? Want a great looking screen? Want amazing battery life? Want great simple software? Yes exactly, that's why this phone is great for 99% of people. Now if all you care about is specs, just walk away, it's not a flagship, but you won't notice unless you're reading a specs sheet. If your just a regular phone user, takes some photos, watches some videos, strolls through social media pages, and does some emails and web browsing, this is the phone for you, save your money. Some more pros, Google photos back up is unlimited, 3 times the amount of cloud storage for free as apple, and they keep pictures completely separate. If you use any type of voice assistant, you'll love having a Google phone for the best assistant experience. Lots of Pixel only features, screen calling in the US is an amazing benifit. Also, if you want to switch from Apple, this is the phone to try it with..
I work in IT and know how to use phones fairly extensively. You should know one thing going into buying the Pixel 3a: it comes with Google's Pixel launcher, meaning that the interface that you're probably use to with other phones (Samsung, Xperia, iPhone, whatever else) is different here. It's a lot simpler to use, and keep in mind if you don't like it, you can download something different from the Play Store.Photos look excellent in my opinion (see my attached photo), navigating around the phone and apps works very quickly, and cell service (T-Mobile) has worked perfectly so far. The phone doesn't have much grip to it, so I recommend buying a case for it.Overall, great phone!.
This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price.Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack.Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included.I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it).However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices.I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image.

Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me.Ordering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time.  I got it in 2 days after Google announced it.  Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc.  Phone powered right up.  Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM.  Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs.  I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes.Phone is awesome.  I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things.  I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive.  Most importantly, the camera is awesome.  Photos are not blurry so far and super clear.  I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options.  I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it.  Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.)It seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable.  However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges.  I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself.  The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping.  Can't say it's worst, just different.  The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years.  I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that.  The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers.Very pleased so far (will update if that changes).  Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife.  She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them.Update after 1 monthBest phone I've ever had.  Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc.  I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time.  I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures.  Battery life is great.  I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times.  I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue.  I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though....
The Google Pixel 3a is not what I was expecting but in the very best way! I have used iPhones for a number of years. However when I recently wanted to upgrade my phone the iPhones on the market we're way out of my price range and I honestly didn't want to sign up for a plan having a monthly payment. I looked into many phones and decided on the Google Pixel 3a. I was surprised how it came with a transfer cable so I didn't loose any of my pictures or music from my old phon. How majority of the apps I had were added as well and all I had to do was sign in again. The camera works amazingly and I no longer have to worry about running out of room for my memories. While the layout and some of the applications are a bit different, I am now a convert! Goodbye Apple, Hello Google!.
When you use a pixel... It kind of spoils you. It's hard to use any other Android after that. Everything is always so smooth and polished. I've had every pixel since the first one and Google hit an absolute home run with this. You get everything you love about the pixel for a shockingly low price. I've had the 3a and 3a XL. Currently typing this from a purpleish XL and it's incredible. The screen is very comparable and even appears brighter than my friends 3 XL. Seriously just buy this phone. For the price it's the very definition of a no brainier!.
I bought two Pixel 3 phones both of which had intermittent call audio quality problems and incoming calls not coming in. At times the issue was so bad that even even Google tech support calls weren't getting through despite having a strong cell signal. After spending hours on the phone with Google tech support and exchanging phones, the problems continued. Google refused to stand behind their product and would not provide a refund as we had spent over 15 days going back and forth with them to try to fix the issues and they only honor refunds within 15 days. Mind you, my experience was with the Pixel 3 not Pixel 3a but if you want to take chances with this poor excuse for a phone manufacturer... go ahead..
This phone just blanked completely out. It just stop working .. I paid like 500 bucks for a broke phone..
It is not clearly stated that this is a T-mobile phone!.
Great phone, but locked to simple mobile!  Will NOT work for Verizon or ATT. Returned the phone:(We returned the phone and after two weeks we still do not have a refund..
It’s Tmobile and not sim-free.
I checked this product for two nights without knowing that it is required to use an attached sim card from Simple Mobile (T-mobile). When I received the package today, I could tell the iPhone has been repackaged at least once. The scratches on the package and the attached Simcard (must use it) struggled me so printed a return label and directly put it at the drop off place for return.Why would anyone (or most of us) want to buy a LOCKED new phone??? I overly trust this product from Apple on Amazon without looking into details. I have gone to Apple Store and gotten a new one (SIM card free).Do Read the reviews before you decide to order!!.
It’s a good phone just it’s sim locked to a T-Mobile account so unless you already have one you need to set up a T-Mobile account but when mine got here it turned out that the SIM card was expired..
Have to wait (90 days) for it to unlock its self. Or switch to Verizon..
Good morning, I bought this article through Amazon and brought it to Panama, I have problems with the phone to unlock it.  What should I do to solve this problem, please.
I bought this iphone when I was passing through the USA. As it was at full price and it is not clear in the announcement I did not pay attention to the fact that it is blocked by the carrier (What is the sense of selling blocked at full price???). Anyway, upon arriving in Brazil I had the unfortunate surprise that he was not working with my local operator's chip. I would like help on how to unlock iPhone so I can use it here?.
Awesome.
It’s great and works great.
phone locked by simple mobile and cannot be unlocked within a year.
I bought the IPhone 11 with an iPhone Pro Max in the AT&T "bogo" promotion. The IPhone 11 arrived on 09/20/19 and the next day I used it to work as a UBER driver.  The GPS did not work. Took too long to give the location, and it was not accurate. I could not keep working. The next day I returned it and bought an iPhone 11 Pro Max. I do not recommend it..
Hehe.
i love the camera on this phone.
Currently Amazon is selling all these new iPhones LOCKED to Simple Mobile for the same price Apple is selling them unlocked. Why????.
Beware!! This is NOT A T-MOBILE EITHER. I own T-Mobile and tried to use my Sim and it failed. It is locked to "Straight Talk" under Simple Mobile. I called simple mobile twice and they said you MUST be a customer of theirs for a year before you can unlock. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME..
Watch the network.
Only for simple mobile.
Noooo.
A locked phone ( been returned a few times).
Not worth it.
Not good.
Problems.
Locked iPhone at full price.
LOVE.

Although i did not buy this phone on Amazon because it was not available in October but I must write this review! I refuse to purchase any phone over $300 or get locked into some 2 year payment pan with T-Mobile or AT&T. Save your hard earned moeny and go with Hauwei Honor 8X.  Purchase your own mid range quality phone which is a true value and then enjoy a lower monthly plan of your choice! I am on a yearly rate with MINT Mobile for next to nothing and everything is running smooth! I am so happy with this HONOR 8X and I upgraded from an already super phone the HUAWEI MATE SE so I am definitely sold on this brand's quality and overall value for your money! This phone is super responsive and will not let you down when it comes to speed and overall performance from the KIRIN 710 Chipset. I urge people who enjoy a larger screen or a Phablet as I call them to go for this phone hands down! Great 6.5 inch screen will blow you away! Huawei and other Chinese companies are really giving the consumer very much to ponder when it comes to bang for your buck! I needed a Dual Sim phone so this one is just crazy! 2 Sims and and 400 GB expansion support!!  I was not paid to write this review I just know this phone is hands down the best phone under $300..
First issue, the title states the phone is JSN-L23 model, but the item I received is JSN-L21. Second, the next issue was the phone sent wouldn't connect to the AT&T network. The description stated it should work with AT&T's network. Sadly, it wouldn't.  I was at an AT&T store for acouple of hours while the employee tried to solve the issue. The AT&T employee even put the sim-card in another phone, which the sim-card was able to connect to the network. So, it wasn't the sim-card but the phone. The description on this product is misleading..
AWESOME BUDGET PHONE FOR ONLY $280 INCLUDED EXPEDITED DELIVERY. VERY SHARP LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS 20MP CAMERA AND 16 MP SELFIE, LONG LAST BATTERY 3750mAh, VERY FLUID APPS 4GB RAM, 64 GB STORAGE UP TO 400GB, 6.5 INCH SCREEN. WOW THE BEST PHONE I EVER GOT AT A GREAT PRICE, STILL LOOKING FOR FAST CHARGE BUT WITH ONLY 50% IT HOLD FOR 9 HRS WITH FACEBOOK, WHATSAPP, CAMERA AND CALLS. ALSO CAME WITH A CASE, HEADPHONES WITH GOOD BASS, CHARGER AND USB CABLE. FRIEND WITH IPHONE X GET SHOCKED WITH MY PHONE NOW IS THINKING GET AN HONOR 8X TOO. I ANALYZE ALL THE RECENT HUAWEI PHONES P20 LITE, Y9, MATE 20 LITE, NOVA 3i, THIS IS THE BEST!!!! ORDERER FROM MOBILES INTL AND RECEIVED CORRECT MODEL L23.
It was exactly the same, came before time with its accessories (earplugs and charger) and I was surprised cause it also came with a clear cover, thou, this one's not really protective, so if you're as sloppy as I am I'd recommend to buy another. But I totally appreciate the intention and also I'm using it..
The phone itself is beautiful and un-boxing it was a joy. The huge screen is great and overall I was ecstatic with my purchase for all of 30 seconds. As I started reading through the instructions I came across a small factor that Huawei cleverly chose not to disclose to customers in the product description and I quote " Dual card Dual Standby Single Pass ... which means you cannot use both sim cards for calls or data services simultaneously". THIS IS NOT DUAL SIM. I have owned several REAL dual sim phones and each and every one of them has had the capability of being able to make and answer calls and use data services simultaneously. That is the whole purpose of having DUAL SIM. If I wanted a glamorized sim holder for my second sim (which is exactly what this phone really is) I would have bought a bedazzled box to put it in, not a phone that is completely miss-advertised as something that it is not. If you want a phone that actually offers fully functional dual sim capability then DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. Quite frankly, without the dual sim function it is nothing more than a paperweight to me. That’s not strictly true ... a paperweight is exactly that and has some level of use. It does not masquerade as something that it is not. This is my second and without a doubt LAST Huawei purchase. If I could give no stars I happily would. PATHETIC!.
The phone is amazing but it does not work for 4g ATT. I can get 3g/H+ but that is it. Wish it got signal strength it's such a great phone..
I got the JSN-L23 model purchased from Mobile International LLC, fulfilled by Amazon. Can confirm that it does work with T-Mobile in the USA with 4G.Everything is great so far, nothing to really complain about except the phone is 2-3 mm thicker than I would prefer. And it's also a little bit heavy in the hand. Quality of display is decent but not as sharp as I had hoped, but still ok. Speakers surprisingly sound quite good and loud enough from that 1 little port on the bottom.  Last thing is EMUI is ugly and takes a little getting used to, good thing is you can put a 3rd party launcher on it to customize to your liking.So far so good...crossing my fingers that it will last!.
I had the Honor 6x and it was o.k. This 8x blows it out of the water! Perfect hand fit, screen is excellent, battery life excellent and runs very smooth. Just received the 8.2 upgrade yesterday. For the price, after 1 week of trying to decide, I am very happy that I bought this one!.
So. I was scary on buying this cause I live in the U. S. soon as I got this honor 8x l23. Version.it a beautiful phone. Comes with a clear case headphone charger..the phone might be a micro USB. But it charges so fast.. 20% to 100% in a hour.and the. The Battery last so long.. I'm a big gamer. And this honor 8x is super fast no lag. Sound is amazing. The camera is so awesome.. Clear and sharp.with so many features.i get 4g lte. With metroPcs. Super fast speed. Oh and android 9.0 Pie will be getting this update soon. Will make phone even more faster.here some sample pics. If you need more info email me enufusion07@gmail.com.
Excellent Phone with excellent Camera, screen and battery life. 100% of All my pictures I have attached are shot in PRO Mode aka manual mode..
I will not repeat the reviews of others, but I will tell you that this phone works great for me on the AT&T network. I am aware of the "missing bands" and I live in a rural area, so was eager to test the data performance. In my testing, I show a 3G connection at my home (which I don't care about as I use wifi 99% of the the time) and when traveling to a nearby rural (but larger) city, I tested at 4G LTE speeds. I was able to stream Netflix at full HD with no buffering at all. Needless to say, I am very happy with this phone for the price point..
I’ve had the Honor 8X for about six weeks now. I’m writing this review primarily for T-Mobile (Metro PCS) customers, but others may find some value in it. There is a lot of confusion regarding the Honor 8X and compatibility with the frequencies (bands) used in the US market. I’m not an expert by any means, but I’ve done a lot of research and obviously purchased the phone. I’m with Metro PCS, so my research is based on T-Mobile’s network. I’m providing what I learned in order to hopefully help others make a well informed decision.First things first… make sure you receive the JSN-L23 model of this phone for use in the States. If they send you anything else, I would return it immediately and order another one from a different seller.This phone supports the following bands & speeds. Please note this phone does support LTE- Advanced which, in theory, is much faster than standard LTE. A lot of your phone’s speed of course will depend on your location and carrier. There are numerous maps on the internet that detail a carrier’s coverage area with speed test results. If you look this phone up, make sure you click JSN-L23.TechnologyGSM / HSPA / LTE2G bandsGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 - SIM 1 & SIM 23G bandsHSDPA 850 / 900 / 1700(AWS) / 1900 / 21004G bandsLTE band 1(2100), 2(1900), 3(1800), 4(1700/2100), 5(850), 7(2600), 28(700), 41(2500)SpeedHSPA, LTE-AT-Mobile’s primary band is band 4 with the secondary band being band 2. T-Mobile also operates on bands 12, 66 & 71 which this phone does not support. Band 12 has been getting a lot of press recently because T-Mobile is working to expand their network coverage. Band 12 is a low frequency band that extends further out while also being able to more easily penetrate structures such as office buildings, so you get a better signal in more rural areas as well as at work for example or inside a store. What people don’t talk about though is band 12’s limited availability. More likely than not, you aren’t even in an area that utilizes band 12. To see a map of implemented and planned band 12 deployments, you can easily find that information on the internet. If you just have to have a phone that supports band 12, I would suggest the Huawei Mate SE US version. It is very similar to the Honor 8X with a 5.93” display and a couple of other differences, but it supports a large number of LTE bands (2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12 & 17). The Mate 20 Lite also appears to be comparable and supports band 12 and has some additional features not available on the Mate SE.I’m not sure why, but a lot of reviewers on Amazon said this phone does not support 4G LTE. There is no LTE designation when my Wi-Fi is on, however when I’m not using Wi-Fi, 4G LTE is clearly visible next to the signal meter.Just a couple of other general points I wanted to share:• The SD card is primarily available to store media content only. From what I read, you cannot download or move apps to the SD card using the stock OS and I really don’t see that option on my phone either.• It took about a week before I received the update to Android 9 Pie. Some folks seem to get the update immediately, but mine came a few days later.• The Huawei user Interface is straight forward and user friendly..
Great phone for the price!Pro:-Comes with a case, charger, pre-installed screen protector, and headphones in the box.-Has flagship phone features for a great price. Finger print/face unlock, large screen, glass back, good cameras with ai and great quality and feel for being 220 roughly.-Comes with Android oreo, but you can update to Android pie.-Comes unlocked for any phone service provider.-Has a headphone jack.-Large amount of storage and you can add more later if needed.-Comes with a dual Sim slot and SD card slot, so you can have two Sim cards and SD card.Cons-No USB type C. Only has a micro USB connector.-Aperture camera mode works good, but needs some improvement.-Back of the phone is a fingerprint magnate.Those are all of the current pros and cons will update with I have the phone for longer.If you have had an honor phone. Then this is a great upgrade from an older model. Or if you are looking for a phone with a bigger display you won't be disappointed. Personally I did changed the launcher and lay out of the phone to something else, but that was for personal preference..
Okay so I was skeptical about buying this device, but my aging galaxy s7 forced my hand. I read the review of this phone maybe not connecting to 4g lte, but can confirm this phone is connected to 4g lte no issue. The phone is an absolute beast and I'm glad I trusted the YouTube videos. It is a beast, no lag when loaded down heavy. I installed my 256gb SD card and you can actually change the default storage location from the device to the SD card which is awesome. Fingerprint scanner is the fastest I have ever used, and the face unlock is faster than my daily driver Iphone XS IF there is good lighting. The cameras on the back are nothing to write home about, but definitely are on par with the S7 it replaced..
I had a Galaxy S9+ and bought this one because wanted a dual SIM + micro SD card. The only thing I miss is the camera. Honor camera is ok, not very good. The rest is just as good as the S9. Battery life is UNBELIEVABLE. some days I hook it at night to charge and it's 90% . And battery saving is not even on. I'm the third day, 70h of use, and my battery is at 36%. Unbelievable. I've never had a cellphone with this battery life, not even close. A cellphone like this, at this price is a steel. Samsung never more..
Love this phone so far! All the positive reviews I read were absolutely right I think it's my favorite phone I've had yet It takes really nice pictures too My son likes the SloMo videos for when he does all his flips and stunts It came right on time and was exactly as described It looked a little long when I first got it and i wasn't sure about that but after using it you forget all about that It actually fits and feels really great in my hands which aren't very big lol The screen is very nice and bright with great colors The battery life is amazing I charge it every night but most of the time it wasn't even dead by then I haven't used the face recognition but I'm sure it's great like everything else I just use the finger unlock which works fast I got the black which is cute Of course it don't look as pretty in the light as the blue would have but I expected that and it's in a case anyways so that doesn't matter to me I just love black lol and it looks good in the teal and black case I got I don't think the blue would look as good since the camera and finger button shows thru the case so I like that it matches the case Im not a big fan of the notch so I turned it off and you can't even tell Everyone didn't like that it don't have the c type charging port But that wasn't a big deal to me I have lots of micro USB chargers so to me it was more convenient that way The phone came with a clear case and headphones which is nice None of my other phones have came with those It has radio on it too which is cool I almost got the Honor 7x cuz I seen lots of good reviews but I decided on the 8x since it was newer and more updated I'm very happy with my choice If you need a new phone try the Honor 8x You can't go wrong!.
I have the honor 6x and I loved it.  I was waiting for the 8x to be released for USA but ultimately it's not going to happen.  After days of searching I found the jsn-l23.I'm on straight talk at&t.  In my area At&t LTE bands 2,4,12 are used.  This phone support 2 & 4 on LTE.  I'm getting good coverage & speed.  10-75 mbs average any where I go.  Occasionally in areas known to be weak I will drop to hspa (3g).  Even still I'm getting 2-10mbs.  Good enough to play YouTube at 1080 with no issues.I would check in your area what bands are being used before buying..
Great phone but the description should not say it is "unlocked" when it is locked and requires the purchase of a key (around 45-60 USD [limited availability for some reason]).  If by "factory unlocked" the description means it isn't carrier specific this should be explicitly mentioned but the phone's bootloader is locked so the description is very misleading..
I will try to explain a lot thing about this phone as many people have concerns/questions regarding the device, first thing is the shipping takes some time i think 5 days, the device arrived and the model number is JSN-L23, the device performance is great as the price is fairly reasonable, I purchased the phone for games only and to be more specific PUBG!This game requires a lot of phone resources to run probably, Will the game is running great on the device, the camera is great too, the overall performance is very good, the downside of the device is its not support dual-band WIFI frequency which is mean is just support 2.4 gh and not 5 gh, its not a big deal to me as i live in the United States and the Internet Service is very good, but still is a downside i guess, The screen resolution is very nice, its also worth mentioning that the device comes with TBU clear case which is nice touch from the company, The sound of the speaker i can say good i guess, Battery life is decent as the battery is 3,750 mAh, also i want to mention that the fingerprint sensor is very fast when it came to recognition,  for Social Media apps so there are no worries their, apps loading time is fast.Bottom line, The overall rating of the device is very good, Happy with the purchase..
I love this phone. It has exceeded my expectations. Works exactly like how the description says it does.- The camera is wonderful and captures clear & crisp photos.- The screen takes up the entire phone and is amazing. It could be argued that you may have to use two hands to use it, but that's typically what you get with a 6.5 inch screen.- The fingerprint sensor works every single time and is extremely fast. I've placed the tip of my finger on it and it unlocks. My first thoughts are "dang it, I'll probably have to retry again" but no, that wasn't the case. It clearly identifies which finger it is and won't unlock to any other fingerprints.- The facial recognition works fast too. In dark settings, it won't recognize your face and that is to be expected.- The phone is very snappy and has no lag.- I live in North Carolina and my carrier is Cricket. I have no problems with my connectivity except for the same ones that I've already had before buying this phone.- I would highly recommend the Honor 8X to other people.- Waking up around noon and constantly on my phone, the battery does drop down to around 60% by the time the clock hits 7pm, but that's not really a problem. Could have a better charger though because the one in the box is a bit too short for me. This is me, moving from a 6 foot charger to the out-of-box charger so...- This phone does have some heft to it. At night, my hand does get heavy while holding the phone. Just be prepared for that.- The box does come with a clear silicon case and it's doing the job. I didn't know that it would come with one, so this surprised me. Granted, I am planning on ordering a new case just to have the extra protection.- My phone also came with a plastic screen protector already installed on it. Didn't even notice it until someone else pointed it out. Great add-on, but like with the phone case, I'm going to or a glass screen protector for the added protection.- Since the back is glass, just know that there will be alot of fingerprints on the back of the phone if you don't have a case on..
I really love this phone.
I transferred from Motorola brand, first Huawei phone. I enjoy the feel of the phone, it's aesthetic, camera quality, and storage space. It's also very customizable which I like and most of pre-downloaded apps are removable. My only concerns are sometimes apps open slowly and it doesn't stay synced with my smartwatch (have to sync it myself throughout the day).Overall, I am enjoying the phone so far!.
Good phone so far, but I've only had it a couple of days. Nice, big screen and clear picture. The phone is just a little buggy, though. The screen will sometimes just go black (but not off, as I can see the status bar up top), even in the middle of use. Sometimes if you tilt the phone, it'll flash back on. Other times, I have to shut off the screen and turn it back on again. Apps run smoothly and when things are running well, they run great, but apps do seem prone to freezing. Definitely better than the cheapo phone I bought off tracfone, but not the best smartphone I've ever used either, though it does the job. I do wish some of the features were more obvious to use rather than having to somehow know all the shortcuts. I had to look up split screen to figure out how to do it (open app and hold down the square button). I tried out another phone that had a split screen option I could just press so that I could reach split screen and later learn the shortcuts.EDIT: Honestly, I'm more and more frustrated by this phone the longer I have it. The battery life is excellent and it does a great job not overheating. However, the darkening screen issue is persistent and annoying, split screen isn't truly split screen (it freezes one app and only loads the active one, which is not useful for my purposes, as switching between two apps even in split screen can cause an app to stop and need reloaded), bluetooth is constantly disconnecting and giving me extraneous warnings about my smartwatch being "powerintensive" with there being no way to shut off the notifications, and the like. The small things just keep building up. I'm honestly surprised this phone was so well recommended in PoGo circles. I'll be trying a different phone when budget allows me to..
The phone has been nothing for marvelous for about a month of use. However, after said time, a black line randomly appeared while I was just watching a video, and it won't go away. I did not drop the phone a single time during the month I've had it, I did not put it through high temperatures, I did not spill anything on it, it's been protected by a case and a screen protector at all times and I have treated it like a god ever since I got it. How on Earth could it get damaged? No other reason than faulty hardware, I'd imagine.I am dumbstruck this happened, I was extremely careful and loving to this phone, I am at an absolute loss..
My options were to buy an Iphone 6s for $150 or surf the web for a better deal; Needless to say Surfing brought me here and I was able to look into Huawei. After contacting at&t online customer service with 2 Huawei Models i was interesting in purchasing they looked in their system and both were compatible! So I ordered the Honor 8X instead of the Mat pro 20 got same day delivered just went into at&t and they swapped my sim worked within minutes perfectly! Dont listen to what people are saying on here about its connectivity... I have unlimited everything and I still get Fast Crisp 4G at the same speed as my iphone on LTE. I assume that people who commented on their connectivity problems my live in areas with Spotty Covered. Great Phone and amazing deal!.
I bought the phone for my wife and so far it has been a month and I haven't heard any complain from her about the phone. Being an international phone, I knew there will be some downside using in US and I think signal strength will be shady in a congested building  specially when using internet. I saw 4G signal with few bars not full signal and LTE signal I guess would not be possible with this version. As long as we get some decent signal, I guess we will be happy. Haven't taken it on the ride to remote areas to really test the signal strength but thats where I am. Again, good phone with all the right features at an affordable price..
You're not really wanting to spend over $300, $400, or more on a smartphone but want something that will last you decent amount of time before upgrading again. This is it.This phone takes a lot of aesthetic/cosmetic features from others, giving you a reasonably priced phone that doesn't feel antiquated at all.I've been using this phone for over a week and it has been a phenomenal experience. I did a fair amount of research prior to buying due to being located in the United States.Will this phone be compatible in the US? yes as long as it is the JSN-l23 model, so as soon as it arrives ensure you received this model if in the U.S.Data speed it's great! But not amazing. I'm willing to make that compromise, especially with a phone this well designed.Battery life is excellent, lasting me a full day with enough to spare for day of light use.(I am a heavy user)The camera is great, take advantage of the "pro" manual control option which let's you really show what this camera can do!.Since Amazon only allows 5 stars, if I could rate this out of ten I'd give it a 9/10.The only flaw being that the reception is not optimized for use in the US but works well still, though I understand things are not well between the U.S. and Huawei..
So i went to cricket! And this phone isn't UNLOCKED, WHO ELSE DO I GO TOO.
I like this phone a lot, and there's only one thing keeping me from loving it--the lack of a NFC module.The screen is great, the battery life is outstanding, it DOES work for me here in the US (Northern Kentucky) using AT&T, and I love being able to use the micro SD card to store endless hours of video and podcasts--all of that is outstanding.But I really wish the seller had mentioned the lack of NFC on this phone (or, if it's here somewhere and I'm not seeing it, I'd wish that it were more prominently displayed).The inability to use the phone for fastpay services is a big deal, and a large part of why I wanted to upgrade from my venerable old phone.This is still a great buy, but be aware that you won't be able to use this for any of the digital payment services out there..
I bought one Honor 8x from ebay (6-128) and it did not work here - due to the band availability. Though I checked the phone specifics, which indicated yes.JSN-L23, this model does work with my ATT network. The other features I liked include -1) I can use my TMobile sim in the same phone (dual sim card slots)2) I can add a MicroSD card to this phone.3) The pictures took using night light mode is great.A few issues I noticed-1) GMail app did not work for me on this phone. I use outlook to access gmail and it worked fine.2) Microsoft Authenticator did not work for me as well. Very interesting. It could be due to the Android OS compatibility issues.Overall it is an excellent phone. It is good for moderate video game playing and regular office needs. For something sold under 300, it is hard to beat its value..
You can't really go wrong for the price, this phone has it all and is very comparable to the expensive high end phones. Battery lasts a long time, it's snappy, the pictures are pretty great for the price. My only real complaint is the speaker but what can you expect. You could easily go out and buy a speaker if it was that big of a deal but overall I would definitely recommend this..
This phone feels great, its solid and well-made. It works on my network in Brooklyn, New York - AT&T - calls, texts and data - all decent speed/ quality. The phone works pretty fast, no lag. The screen is awesome - bright and sharp - but only ok in bright daylight. The camera is pretty good, but not great. The color is a little off and images are poor in low lighting. Also video is really not great - shaky.Overall is this is an amazing value phone for just over 200 bucks and I am happy I bought it. Seems like way better value than a super expensive iphone!!!!.
I absolutely love this phone. I had concerns buying an international phone but have had no connectivity issues in Central Florida . Everything works great.Fingerprint and face recognition work flawlessly. Software is a little different from my other Huawei phone but nothing terrible.I am so glad I decided to get this phone..
Bought this for great battery life on my Millennial son's recommendation and love the face recognition and fingerprint ID built in. I can get a full 2 days life out of this on one charge, and it charges up FAST! Easy set up and file transfer from my old phone and I am in my early 60's. Love the size of the screen and the built in pedometer. So many great functions built in. Speaker is small but surprisingly good. Couldn't be happier!.
Really good phone if you're on a budget. What I paid for this phone left me enough to buy screen protectors and a case for it as opposed to buying a phone from the store, only to find out the phone comes with a case and headphones. Has way more features than what I thought initially so a bonus. The camera is awesome; really good battery life, but I'm was not a fan on how short the charging cable was, but I can live with it. I used to be a strictly LG phone consumer specifically the stylo and considered the VthinQ but at the price I paid for this phone and the amazing features on it safe to say I have a new fav. It also works on cricket fine for whomever that may concern.
So I just purchased this phone because my Sony Xperia xa2 drowned. So I looked around and this phone had caught my eye. Now when I purchase a phone I do an extreme amount of research. Ive had an Samsung s8 before my sony. and I must say, this phone Is great. Looks great, Feels great. I like the user interface much more than samsungs setup. I have simple mobile and it works on their network. Check the bands of your carrier and see if they match the bands for this phone. I even thought well maybe the camera is going to be s******, it takes great photos. The only complaints I have is that the charging is micro usb, not type c. but it still charges almost as fast as type C. and that Huawai tries to make you sign up for more than the average U.S. phone would ask. But you don't have to. Battery lasts about 2 days. Huge variety of cases too. Also it takes a Nano SIM. so that's sweet. I recommend if you want to save money, have a up to date looking phone, and good quality. It released in sept 2018 and with 4gb of ram its still smooth. And has PIE update! it could have came out yesterday and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. sweet stuff!.
I bought this phone for taking camping to watch movies on only!  I bought the 64 gb after the apps / software I have 50gb left. For around $ 30 dollars More I Really should of got the 128gb just woke up one morning & decided to buy the phone & didn’t quite have enough on my CC to get the 128gb. I shouldn’t of been in a hurry & waited a couple more days to transfer $$ to the CC.
Hi guys ...i bought this device and it very good phone but there not LTE  just 4G  with METRO PCS and i called the company and they said this device has the same bands they use it in my area and i living in city ...so if you wanna buy this device forgot about LTE and if anybody has LTE with MTRO PCS  just let us see pic for  your phone works with LTE....Update my review...after one month and after call Metro pcs many times they fix the problame and i have 4g lte now ...thank you ...i gonna give five stars to this phone.
Don't let the negative Chinese product reviews deter you from getting a great deal. This phone is fantastic. Screen is great because the videos, pictures, and images are crisp and clear. The ring tone and sound is loud enough that even my near deaf mom can hear. The camera also takes great pictures which was one reason I got this item. The plus is that it works on T-Mobile and came in one day as they say. Also, it runs the Google apps and Huawei apps. And there's a great Huawei health app that lets me know how many steps I have walked at work or for the day. Not bad for a phone that is under 200 bucks. Two thumbs up!!.
This is a wonderful bargain phone that, so far, works more like a bigger budget one. I had to replace a lost phone in a hurry so when a search on Huawei phones brought this one up, I took a gamble & purchased it.  On the positive side,*The price can't be beat. I purchased mine for $185 & now, the price has dropped even lower*Screen size and display: both are on par with some of the mid-budget phones out there (6.5 in.) and the images are sharp. It also makes it easier to type, especially longer passages*Split- screens: this phone allows you to have a split-screen both vertically and horizontally while seeing both screens clearly.*Camera: the quality of the pictures with this phone is a much-needed upgrade from the Mate SE. They look nicer and the flash function will automatically brighten a pic & the image comes out sharper.*Space: With 4gb ram, things move fast & storage is really good too (64 gb internal storage plus space for a SD card)*Settings: this phone has a lot more options for customizing the phone to your taste, including how you want the apps to appear, swapping options, etc.CONS:*Charging: one of the few issues with this phone. You can't quick charge (it can take 3-5 hrs.) . It also doesn't do wireless charging on its own; you much purchase a wireless receiver to attach to your phone & a separate charging holder. However, the charge does last longer when completely charged.*Screen: the screen itself seems to be a bit more sensitive to falls. I've already have a couple knicks on it (not noticable to the naked eye but enough to realize that it's not something hard stuck on it that needs to come off)*Huawei apps: some of the apps don't seem to work at all, though it appears to be available. The magazine unlock option doesn't work, for example, and there is hardly any wallpapers to choose from. I'm also having a hard time creating a Huawei account..
This phone has exceeded my expectations. It has fantastic battery life, a decent camera and a great display. The OS definitely takes some getting used to. Overall great value for money..
Great product! Loving it so far. Would edit and give 5 star if this phone lasts for a long time..
El teléfono es muy versátil, el procesador es rápido, la pantalla tiene excelente resolución y es de buen tamaño, tiene buena capacidad de almacenamiento y por sobretodo la cámara es increíble..
I seriously love everything about this phone. I was a bit nervous before getting it cause of the price but omg. It's amazing. I will never even think about buying a Samsung or iPhone again!.
this is the best buy for a phone for me. The pixels are better than the s9 both back and front camera, runs smooth, no issues with calls or text, etc. Apple and Samsung need to get together if they want to make sales in the next decade. Now this is not an issue at all to me but I regret not getting the blue or red version as the design they have for those is stunning but overall would recommend getting this you are basically getting and s9 in a way by itself all for $200+ plus theres already 40Gb in the phone and the transferring of data from your old phone is too easy. Overtime, I will come back to this review to update my experience but so far I'm more than satisfied with this purchase.
One of the best phones I've ever owned.  Great battery! I usually only charge it, every other day.  It has a fast processor, amazingly clear pictures.I have no complaints and highly recommend..
Using a straight talk tmobile sims card service works perfectly fine, I get 4G service too. Was sent the correct model number nothing bad to say about the phone at all, it works wonderfully..
The feature-packed on this phone in such a cheap price is unbelievable. I am using this for over 2 months and it's working absolutely fine for me. No complaint at all.Note: I had faced a problem earlier, my Facebook, Gmail and few other apps were closing automatically after a few seconds. The seller was super nice and offered me a full refund, but I did not have to take it. The problem solved after factory resetting..
I came to the Honor 8x after 2 years if using the Honor 6x (screen cracked). I was hesitant about whether it would work in the US, but I can confirm that it does work on the Cricket Network in Florida. However, you cannot register a support account in the US. Oh well.Screen is taller than the 6x, and not as easy to use one handed. I have to shift my hand to access the top and bottom buttons, and I have large hands. Landscape typing is not as great either because the keyboard takes up the entire screen.That being said, the camera seems better, and the large screen is nice. It does come with a thin screen protector installed and a thin, clear plastic phone case if you want to try that before ordering an aftermarket case.UI is not as good as the 6x, but I'll get used to it. Overall I'm pleased..
I absolutely love this phone it is amazing. But due to it being a foreign phone it can only work on certain companies (T-Mobile being one of the few in America to work). The screen is also pretty easily scratched so a screen protector is a must. Other then that it's a top tier value phone..
I was afraid to buy these phone from the beginning because somebody said it's not going to work in USA but I bought it and it was the best phone on my life it works great on metro PCS i got 4g lte signal here in Oregon very fast procceer. Amazing camera,  dont be afraid to buy these phone and i am pretty sure you will be very happy with these phone and dont believe who said its not going to work in usa they all seller for the iPhone and Samsung as well and they trying to ruin (huawei) reputation just make sure to receive the JSN L23 version these is  the only version work on usa once you resive the right one your on the safe side, and guarantee it is going to work 100% with GSM carrier the phone will show before you update that you got 4g but Actually you got 4g lte and after you update the phone you to android pie 9.0 will see 4g lte on your screen so no worries in my opnion i beleive these honor 8x  better than the samsung s10 ,  these phone is excellent in everything and the best....
I've had this phone for about a month now and I absolutely love it. The size, the hardware, and the camera are all far past my expectations for an android phone. Everything is great except for the messaging. I suggest using either a third party messaging app or you'll have to deal with "undownloaded messages" constantly. Also, since he phone is the international version, it only supports GSM and not LTE as the product says it does. This is not much of a problem for me, but I'm probably going to buy the US version if/when it's released..
I could not believe the value. for $200 I got a top of the line phone with full HD, 6.5 inch screen, and blazing fast responsiveness. The battery lasts me over three days of continual use!! The camera is of higher quality than I originally expected, and there is almost NO Bloatware!!! Maybe an app or two that I uninstalled but I am in love with this brand.Ended up buying the 8a model as well with this one.
Before purchasing I took the time to read so many reviews and got mixed reviews whether it would work or not.  I am Located in S.E. of the U.S.  using T-Mobile and Strait Talk.So I bought this particular model (Honor 8X) in hopes to eliminate carrying work and personal phone.  Knowing the LTE DOES NOT WORK with T-mobile nor Straight Talk, I took the risk.  First impression:  The phone is well packages and phone is aesthetically pleasing.  If you're familiar at all with the Android platform, nothing is different.  Phone is wicked responsive along with the facial recognition works very well.  The only con there is that the it doesn't work on band 12 for the LTE, which kills my signal in some areas and especially in buildings.  If it weren't for that, I would've kept the phone..
First i am really liking the phone this is a big upgrade from the samsung S5 , but the only thing i am really frustrated right now is if your living in the USA you can not register the huawei ID , in order for you to use the huawei app system you need a the Huawei id. So far form what i was told you can only use all of googles apps so if you guys are living in the usa make sure you register for google its the only thing that makes any apps usable.
So far the phone works really well after a week of using. My only gripe is that I ordered a blue and got a black. But besides that everything is great.
i would give this phone negative stars if i could. This phone lasted one month. This is the second  Huawei phone i have bought that lasted less than 2 months--and the company provided no support/replacement etc. Never again..
Love it. My previous phone barely fell and then it got damaged. My new phone has taken a few tumbles (with a case) and it's still in great condition. The screen is great, face unlock works well, fingerprint is quick. Overall....great purchase! For the price... definitely value for your money..
Takes excellent photos, has a mode for night shots. Overall phone performance is snappy, in the hand feels like a much more expensive phone. Screen display is bright and crisp..
Actually a very nice looking and usable phone. Fast and smooth for 4gb of ram it does the trick. Battery lasts all day power using and charges relatively fast. No wireless charging though which stinks. Only been 4 days using it so I can't say in the long run it'll be. System 9.0 update has flaws you lose led notification light and seems a bit buggy so stay on 8.0 for a while till 9.1 rolls out. Decent phone decent price..
Screen cracks very very easily even with a protector. All it took was one drop from about a foot. I have cut my fingers multiple times on the glass. The whole reason I got this phone is because my last one finally cracked after years of abuse. This one held up for a couple weeks and is cracked much worse. I knew that $200 price tag had a catch..
Im very happy with this phone. Its amazing, run very smoothly, screen is excellent, the sound is a little bit low and the camara works very well. Would recommend this Phone to anyone who dont want to spend more than 300$ for a device..
I am so sad this phone did not work for me! It really is a great phone with great features but I could not get service using an AT&T sim card or a Verizon sim card that both worked in other phones. Also it came with a charger for a European outlet, which wouldn't have been an issue for me if it actually worked, and the dual sim is just so you can store two sim cards at once. I don't know what the reason for it not working in the US is but I hope they can resolve it or at the very least stop misleading people..
It’s a great phone.I focus in camera and battery life .The camera is wonderful and the night mode is great.I charged it and the battery work with me for one day and 17 hours with regular usage (social media, YouTube and gallery and calls).I ordered also screen protector and cover but I found both with the phone itself …. Awesome.My friend asked  me about the price and he think it more expensive by 100 dollars .Large screen size but the phone size looks normal … I don’t know how they do it.Processor is very fast especially facial recognition works fast too.One disadvantage, there is no battery fast charge feature.Actually I don’t like to change many phones, and I think this one will stay with me for long time.Overall the phone is great and I like it.
The phone does so much! I The finger print scanner is spot on amazing. I was concerned that I wouldn't like the size but I've gotten used to it & it is an excellent phone especially for the money! It is an amazing bargain. I & goodnight recommend the phone..
Phone was pretty good lots of features the Bluetooth quality is what killed it 4 me.  Need my music in my car.  2 much static.
Hey, i am running about 22 days with the phone. It is veru good, i dont find the word to describe how good it is. batery, and the phone always send you some sugestions, which aplication is consumed the batery. The only problem i bougth it to use it in Dominican Republic, is the internet, i cant use my 3G, it just have LTE options, and it is a litle bit slow sometimes at home, but outsider it is good. I cant complaint..
Producto de alta qualidade. La imagen es perfecta, es lindo, veloz. Excelente.
This is a great phone for the price. Probably as close to an iPhone is you're going to get at this price. Great call quality.Only 2 drawbacks: 1) It is not dual band (2.4 GHz band only); 2) Old micro USB charging capabilityOther than that, no complaints. Even came with a free case..
The great phone does exactly everything my Samsung did without any problems. Battery life is much better than my old Samsung and actually dropped it twice while waiting for my phone case to arrive and the glass has a small scratch on the corner and can't believe the glass did not break. Very happy with this phone and highly recommend to anyone..
Above and beyond what I expected at this price. Works perfectly on AT&T so far..
Ha sido una gran experiencia haber comprado este producto y haberle entregado mi confianza a HUAWEI, esta nueva linea de producto HONOR es increible, celulares gama media con altisimo rendimiento y caracteristicas que te dejan asombrado. Muy buena compra, el envio fue rapido y efectivo. Muchas gracias! Espero poder disfrutar al maximo este gran smartphone..
I jumped on the budget bandwagon about 2 years ago when I purchased the Honor 5x. It was an adequate phone for the low price. I decided to stick with Honor this time around because of my past experience. Let me tell you the 8x doesn't disappoint. I don't think you'll get a better phone at the 225$ price point.
The phone I received had multiple issues. The phone would get too hot in a short period of time, even though I'm not gaming or using high-end apps. There was also a spot of the screen where it would act on its own so it was very difficult to use. The phone looks nice and the camera is good for the price, but the issues I had with it made me want to return it..
I have used the phone for a few days since it was purchased and I would mostly be very positive to this phone generally. The features are pretty much very good for a mid range phone. If asked if I would buy it again, I would say yes, especially if you are looking for a budgeted phone that gets the job done..
my iphone 5 battery no longer charge. I can't afford new iphone 10 max.this will domy carrier is Cricket, just pop the iphone 5 sim out and put in honor 8x and it works fine.
For the price this is a great smart phone. I would recommend it. The only thing that I didn't like about the phone was that I coundnt use samsung apps.
The phone is over all super great, I just had a problem with it and I had to returned it, the reason why I returned it was, because I use the hot spot a lot and I noticed something on the phone, every time I use the hot spot, it cut the data from the phone, so if I was using the hot spot, I coudn't use the internet from the phone. That was a very big issue for me, other that that I really recommend this phone.
Phone is great beyond flagship camera has a 6.5 in screen and does so many cool things I never even imagined all for a cheap price.
Love this phone - battery works for days! The reviews that say this phone doesn't work in the U.S. are incorrect. When I was setting the phone up I got an error message stating, 'This product will not work in your area. We're sorry for the inconvenience.' (I'm in TN.) However, this is just for the Huawei ID app - their cloud, etc, so I just used the skip option and use my Google account. I stuck in the sim card from my other phone and bam, it stated working immediately without taking it to my carrier store or anything.Great phone, EXCELLENT camera, great price!.
Since this phone has limited frequencies (bands) available for each model, it is important to recieve the correct model, however my model was not the listed on the description, luckily my phone works . the phone itself it is a great phone for the price, it makes the job done..
This phone is one of the "too good to be true" deals but holy crap is it an AMAZING PHONE! Have had for a little over 3 weeks now and haven't had a problem with it at all. I came from Samsung and LG phones and the difference in terms of software was very easy to get used to. Screen is huge and crystal clear. Battery life is way better than I expected! Only downside is that it's not a type-c charging port. But can't believe this phone is this cheap! Huawei brand has found a return customer!.
I bought this phone after thinking about it for a few weeks and finally bought it. I was impressed with the battery life, screen, and how fast it is. But this phone company Huawei is getting banned in the U. S. And Im returning it..
This is my first Huiwei smart phone and I use it to replace my LG K7 whose battery is not good enough after just one year's use.  This Huawei Honor showed Excellent battery life, camera, and screen quality, and I will definately recommend it to my friends..
FAR BETTER than I could have expected for the price.  Fingerprint reader is SUPER fast and accurate.  Things that didn't work on a 3 year old phone DO NOW on this one.  Battery life is excellent.  Very satisfied..
Love Huawei phones and this one is no exception. Everything from purchase to deliver was satisfying. Only issue is that I couldn't set up in United States as region for phone for to this option not being available. Had to set up in nearby Mexico causing some issues, however service is great and it's what you'd expect outta a Huawei device..

Although i did not buy this phone on Amazon because it was not available in October but I must write this review! I refuse to purchase any phone over $300 or get locked into some 2 year payment pan with T-Mobile or AT&T. Save your hard earned moeny and go with Hauwei Honor 8X.  Purchase your own mid range quality phone which is a true value and then enjoy a lower monthly plan of your choice! I am on a yearly rate with MINT Mobile for next to nothing and everything is running smooth! I am so happy with this HONOR 8X and I upgraded from an already super phone the HUAWEI MATE SE so I am definitely sold on this brand's quality and overall value for your money! This phone is super responsive and will not let you down when it comes to speed and overall performance from the KIRIN 710 Chipset. I urge people who enjoy a larger screen or a Phablet as I call them to go for this phone hands down! Great 6.5 inch screen will blow you away! Huawei and other Chinese companies are really giving the consumer very much to ponder when it comes to bang for your buck! I needed a Dual Sim phone so this one is just crazy! 2 Sims and and 400 GB expansion support!!  I was not paid to write this review I just know this phone is hands down the best phone under $300..
First issue, the title states the phone is JSN-L23 model, but the item I received is JSN-L21. Second, the next issue was the phone sent wouldn't connect to the AT&T network. The description stated it should work with AT&T's network. Sadly, it wouldn't.  I was at an AT&T store for acouple of hours while the employee tried to solve the issue. The AT&T employee even put the sim-card in another phone, which the sim-card was able to connect to the network. So, it wasn't the sim-card but the phone. The description on this product is misleading..
AWESOME BUDGET PHONE FOR ONLY $280 INCLUDED EXPEDITED DELIVERY. VERY SHARP LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS 20MP CAMERA AND 16 MP SELFIE, LONG LAST BATTERY 3750mAh, VERY FLUID APPS 4GB RAM, 64 GB STORAGE UP TO 400GB, 6.5 INCH SCREEN. WOW THE BEST PHONE I EVER GOT AT A GREAT PRICE, STILL LOOKING FOR FAST CHARGE BUT WITH ONLY 50% IT HOLD FOR 9 HRS WITH FACEBOOK, WHATSAPP, CAMERA AND CALLS. ALSO CAME WITH A CASE, HEADPHONES WITH GOOD BASS, CHARGER AND USB CABLE. FRIEND WITH IPHONE X GET SHOCKED WITH MY PHONE NOW IS THINKING GET AN HONOR 8X TOO. I ANALYZE ALL THE RECENT HUAWEI PHONES P20 LITE, Y9, MATE 20 LITE, NOVA 3i, THIS IS THE BEST!!!! ORDERER FROM MOBILES INTL AND RECEIVED CORRECT MODEL L23.
It was exactly the same, came before time with its accessories (earplugs and charger) and I was surprised cause it also came with a clear cover, thou, this one's not really protective, so if you're as sloppy as I am I'd recommend to buy another. But I totally appreciate the intention and also I'm using it..
The phone itself is beautiful and un-boxing it was a joy. The huge screen is great and overall I was ecstatic with my purchase for all of 30 seconds. As I started reading through the instructions I came across a small factor that Huawei cleverly chose not to disclose to customers in the product description and I quote " Dual card Dual Standby Single Pass ... which means you cannot use both sim cards for calls or data services simultaneously". THIS IS NOT DUAL SIM. I have owned several REAL dual sim phones and each and every one of them has had the capability of being able to make and answer calls and use data services simultaneously. That is the whole purpose of having DUAL SIM. If I wanted a glamorized sim holder for my second sim (which is exactly what this phone really is) I would have bought a bedazzled box to put it in, not a phone that is completely miss-advertised as something that it is not. If you want a phone that actually offers fully functional dual sim capability then DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. Quite frankly, without the dual sim function it is nothing more than a paperweight to me. That’s not strictly true ... a paperweight is exactly that and has some level of use. It does not masquerade as something that it is not. This is my second and without a doubt LAST Huawei purchase. If I could give no stars I happily would. PATHETIC!.
The phone is amazing but it does not work for 4g ATT. I can get 3g/H+ but that is it. Wish it got signal strength it's such a great phone..
I got the JSN-L23 model purchased from Mobile International LLC, fulfilled by Amazon. Can confirm that it does work with T-Mobile in the USA with 4G.Everything is great so far, nothing to really complain about except the phone is 2-3 mm thicker than I would prefer. And it's also a little bit heavy in the hand. Quality of display is decent but not as sharp as I had hoped, but still ok. Speakers surprisingly sound quite good and loud enough from that 1 little port on the bottom.  Last thing is EMUI is ugly and takes a little getting used to, good thing is you can put a 3rd party launcher on it to customize to your liking.So far so good...crossing my fingers that it will last!.
I had the Honor 6x and it was o.k. This 8x blows it out of the water! Perfect hand fit, screen is excellent, battery life excellent and runs very smooth. Just received the 8.2 upgrade yesterday. For the price, after 1 week of trying to decide, I am very happy that I bought this one!.
So. I was scary on buying this cause I live in the U. S. soon as I got this honor 8x l23. Version.it a beautiful phone. Comes with a clear case headphone charger..the phone might be a micro USB. But it charges so fast.. 20% to 100% in a hour.and the. The Battery last so long.. I'm a big gamer. And this honor 8x is super fast no lag. Sound is amazing. The camera is so awesome.. Clear and sharp.with so many features.i get 4g lte. With metroPcs. Super fast speed. Oh and android 9.0 Pie will be getting this update soon. Will make phone even more faster.here some sample pics.

Although i did not buy this phone on Amazon because it was not available in October but I must write this review! I refuse to purchase any phone over $300 or get locked into some 2 year payment pan with T-Mobile or AT&T. Save your hard earned moeny and go with Hauwei Honor 8X.  Purchase your own mid range quality phone which is a true value and then enjoy a lower monthly plan of your choice! I am on a yearly rate with MINT Mobile for next to nothing and everything is running smooth! I am so happy with this HONOR 8X and I upgraded from an already super phone the HUAWEI MATE SE so I am definitely sold on this brand's quality and overall value for your money! This phone is super responsive and will not let you down when it comes to speed and overall performance from the KIRIN 710 Chipset. I urge people who enjoy a larger screen or a Phablet as I call them to go for this phone hands down! Great 6.5 inch screen will blow you away! Huawei and other Chinese companies are really giving the consumer very much to ponder when it comes to bang for your buck! I needed a Dual Sim phone so this one is just crazy! 2 Sims and and 400 GB expansion support!!  I was not paid to write this review I just know this phone is hands down the best phone under $300..
First issue, the title states the phone is JSN-L23 model, but the item I received is JSN-L21. Second, the next issue was the phone sent wouldn't connect to the AT&T network. The description stated it should work with AT&T's network. Sadly, it wouldn't.  I was at an AT&T store for acouple of hours while the employee tried to solve the issue. The AT&T employee even put the sim-card in another phone, which the sim-card was able to connect to the network. So, it wasn't the sim-card but the phone. The description on this product is misleading..

ALSO CAME WITH A CASE, HEADPHONES WITH GOOD BASS, CHARGER AND USB CABLE. FRIEND WITH IPHONE X GET SHOCKED WITH MY PHONE NOW IS THINKING GET AN HONOR 8X TOO. I ANALYZE ALL THE RECENT HUAWEI PHONES P20 LITE, Y9, MATE 20 LITE, NOVA 3i, THIS IS THE BEST!!!! ORDERER FROM MOBILES INTL AND RECEIVED CORRECT MODEL L23.
It was exactly the same, came before time with its accessories (earplugs and charger) and I was surprised cause it also came with a clear cover, thou, this one's not really protective, so if you're as sloppy as I am I'd recommend to buy another. But I totally appreciate the intention and also I'm using it..
The phone itself is beautiful and un-boxing it was a joy. The huge screen is great and overall I was ecstatic with my purchase for all of 30 seconds. As I started reading through the instructions I came across a small factor that Huawei cleverly chose not to disclose to customers in the product description and I quote " Dual card Dual Standby Single Pass ... which means you cannot use both sim cards for calls or data services simultaneously". THIS IS NOT DUAL SIM. I have owned several REAL dual sim phones and each and every one of them has had the capability of being able to make and answer calls and use data services simultaneously. That is the whole purpose of having DUAL SIM. If I wanted a glamorized sim holder for my second sim (which is exactly what this phone really is) I would have bought a bedazzled box to put it in, not a phone that is completely miss-advertised as something that it is not. If you want a phone that actually offers fully functional dual sim capability then DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. Quite frankly, without the dual sim function it is nothing more than a paperweight to me. That’s not strictly true ... a paperweight is exactly that and has some level of use. It does not masquerade as something that it is not. This is my second and without a doubt LAST Huawei purchase. If I could give no stars I happily would. PATHETIC!.
The phone is amazing but it does not work for 4g ATT. I can get 3g/H+ but that is it. Wish it got signal strength it's such a great phone..
I got the JSN-L23 model purchased from Mobile International LLC, fulfilled by Amazon. Can confirm that it does work with T-Mobile in the USA with 4G.Everything is great so far, nothing to really complain about except the phone is 2-3 mm thicker than I would prefer. And it's also a little bit heavy in the hand. Quality of display is decent but not as sharp as I had hoped, but still ok.

It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it..
Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life.
Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video.
Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes..
There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product..
Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone..
Amazing mobile for best price happy with product.
Been using from the last few days, here are my first imperssions of the device.Pros:1. Display: The 6.2"" display is awesome. Samsung has again proved its excellence in the displays. Colors are sharp and viewing angles are good. The notch, which Samsung calls Infinity-V, looks way more appealing than the ugly notch in other devices in this price bracket.2. Camera: The 13MP camera is good for low-light shots. To top it all, the secondary camera of 5MP has an ultra-wide lens, which captures way more than a normal shot.3. Design: Phone seems sleek and light-weight. One handed use is also very easy.4. Face-Unlock: Face unlock is smooth and fast. There is also a v-shaped animation when you unlock the phone, which looks great.Cons:1. The 16GB storeage is a little less, but the memory card slot is a dedicated one, expandable upto 512GB, which more than makes up for it.Overall verdict: Terrific buy and value for money features in this segment.".
1. The Display is amazing at the price point2. Great online video experience3. Extra game launcher helps play games easily and without lags4. Many new features and better than Redmi Note 6 pro in terms of display.5. Slim phone handy.ConsCamera lags in low light.
There are many other 5* reviews but read this.Buy this only in 2 case:1. If your need is only basic requirement like Calls, Messages, average camera but good battery.2. You are Samsung fan boy.There are many reasons why you should not buy.Few Main Reasons:1. Lags a lot while using 2-3 apps.2. PUBG doesn't work, lags. So you can't play it.3. Sometimes, Mobile gets unlocked by any face, so there's no security.4. No fingerprint sensor.5. Many other better mobiles available at this price range.6. Many more....In short, avoid this & buy any other device..
not opend faster face unlock.
Very nice and wonderful perfect slim designDisplay quality very nice Samsung' mobile phone.
Much awaited phone from Samsung, had been waiting for this for a long time.Pros:Great  Display, best in this price so farBattery life is good, although a fast charger would have been nice, but can't complain too much at this price.Dual Sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot upto 512GB is awesome for storage needs, despite the 16GB internal memory.Processor: Processor is more than enough for day to day tasks and there is no lag.Looks: Pretty Sleek and feels easy in the handsOS: Runs on oreo, i was expecting Pie, but Samsung has indicated that the update will come pretty soon, so not too much worried about that.In-built apps: Bloatware has been reduced to a minimum and the new Samsung Experience 9.5 UI feels very fast and snappy.Final Verdict: Great bargain buy, with powerpacked features..
Jabardast, display me toh maja aagaya and performance is awesome.slidely camera are improvement and face unlock are fast my next update but phone is great..
The best phone on market in this price range.
Phone look is awesomeBut speed is very slow like j4Lag between apps switching and multitasking.
Value for money excellent battery ,camera.
1.6 ghz processor, 3 GB RAM and 32 GB memo are not synced together and therefore the phone doesn't have speed. hangs every now and then. PUBG exp is worst it takes time to focus and shoot and by then ur game is over.  face recognition AI doesnt works. interface is ok. charging takes more than 3 hours. so no fast charge as claimed by the company. all in all, good if you have expectation, bad if you are buying it for performance..
Samsung Galaxy M10 is better for middle-class peoplewith excellent featuresit has dual rear camera one is 13 MP and second is 5it has infinity V notch displayand display size is 6.22 inches (15 cm).
The flash light is there at the top middle of the screen due to which almost 10% part of any video will not be visible (in short, heads of character will not be visible).This seems to be a defect in this mobile, I am gonna return it..
This may be the phone many people looking for. But as we all know nothing is perfect, it is also same. I got a defective unit which I had to replace and thanks to Amazon services for verifying my phone's microphone due to which other side person was always unable to here my voice. Finally I got my replacement.While bought, I was expecting superior service from a top brand when I bought this phone but they let me down. Rating single star. Why?So, Let me share you facts about this phone so you can know it better,**************INSIDE BOX**************1. Mobile phone2. Charging USB cable3. Charging adapter4. User manual5. Leaflets / warranty card6. (No back cover Back cover given like I got with redme 6 pro ordered with same price same day)*******PROS:*******1. With 3400mAh, Battery life is dependable,2. Good quality pictures with primary dual & single secondary, cameras in daylight,3. 3.5mm Audio jack,4. Dual SIM and micro SD cards can be used at same time,5. Expandable memory,6. It's cheapest branded phone with with latest features like notch, dual cams,7.  Broader screen display with a tiny notch in budget*******CONS:*******1. Ships with Android 8.1 Oreo instead of Pie. And not upgraded even after updating software,2. Broader display looks good but makes it prone to breakage,3. In the era of LED display it's offering LCD display,4. No water-proofing (this is a feature which we cannot expect in this range presently),5. OIS, EIS not available can result shaky footage,6. Lowlight performance is not good and both rear and front cameras fail to give detail in low light.7. NFC is no more requirement of future, it's not available in it,8. Image quality disappoints, Below average performance. Images shake while during camera movement and image taking process is slow,9. Video Quality 4K is not available,10. Loudspeaker performance is average. Stereo speakers sound is low and display light is less brighter,11. No fingerprint reader,12. No notification light sensor,13. Rear-facing loudspeaker are relatively quiet loudspeaker, notto mention it's rear-facing.15. Charges really slow with the included charger. The charger is 5V 1A only and takes more than 3 hours to fully charge the devices,16. The only biometric security feature (face unlock) is slow and unreliable.17. Performance even in day-to-day usage is rather underwhelming.18. While playing Heavy games like PUBG there is a little bit heating issue,19. Old and outdated processer, the Exynos processor used in M10 is 2.5 years old and doesn't perform well.20. Final thing I observed is that this phone has less networks coverage****************FINAL VEDICT:****************So final findings are - the Samsung M10's battery life is okay, the ultra wide-angle lens is average, the whole camera experience is comparable to the rest of the phones in its class, although LCD display not very bright, the screen is okay too. And that's all there is to say about the Galaxy M10. Despite its low price, it's a tough one to recommend when you have the Realme 3 and Redme 6 pro selling for the same price. The Galaxy M10 just has too many serious shortcomings. You will have to live with an underpowered SoC, average battery life, no fingerprint reader, no LED light sensor.Also, the face unlock is really slow and unreliable so it's not an adequate alternative to the good old fingerprint scanner. And if you decide to spend a few bucks extra then you can go for the Redmi Note 7, you will have literally lesser of the issues than this.
Nyc product..... from samsung n thank u amazon ...
love.
Amazon send me the defective piece and I didn't get any help from Amazon customer service. When I told the problem what I am facing, they ignored and said that item is ok because we found no issue when check with smartcheck app. There are a lot of problems which can't be analyze by smartcheck app. The problem is with the speaker and mic. When I play music, sound is ok, but when I call to someone the sound is come back two to three times from speaker. It looks like that the sound is surrounding around us. It is very irritating to me and the other one too who is on call. My experience is very bad with Amazon customer care executive. I don't want refund, I just wanna replace the defective piece. They didn't help me to replace this defective item..
Phone looks good with advanced feature.
My review about this phone1. Look wise the phone looks good2. Speaker is very low3. Camera is worst4. Gaming wise it is not up to the mark, PUBG is set to LOW setting and face much lag. You will need headphone to play otherwise you will not hear sound with the inbuilt speaker.5. Performance wise it does not lag much..
very look nice model.
Great camera, especially with ultra wide feature. Live focus feature works great as well, with amazing portrait shots from both the front as well as rear cameras. Picture detailing is good considering the price point. Camera is smooth without any lags, camera app is also very intuitive and easy to use..
I buy this one few days before. A gift for my uncle. When we open it's for the first time. And i put charge for 4 hours . Then I turned on .it doesn't turn on and restart continues with Samsung logo startup. A service man comes and checked. It was software issues. I contact Amazon many times for a replacement no one doesn't contact me. I trusted Amazon and Samsung it was a huge disappointment for me..
WORTH PRICE.
I like its display but I don't like  storage options of m10 2gb variant.Its hanging some time without adding extra apps....
good deal with 8000 looking premium.
The phone has a sleek and crisp design. Love the infinity V display with dew drop notch, its clearly oneof the best and first striking features of the phone. The 6.2 inches screen is excellent for watchingvideos and playing games. THE colour display is also extremely good. The colours are vibrant andcrisp. The 3400 mAh battery works decently well so that you don't have to charge your phone all thetime. The camera is decent and clicks nice and decent pictures. Low light pictures are also decent. Thecamera quality is pretty good .The wide angle mode is really fun to use and is good for clicking grouppictures and wide angle shots. The phone is light in weight and can be carried around easily. Thephone looks extremely stylish in hand and is definitely extremely good looking for a budget phone.To be honest I am loving the new Samsung Galaxy M10 for its amazing design, dual camera, greatpicture quality, and all the other amazing features.There is nothing not to love in this power packed new Samsung Galaxy M10..
Dual camera with ultra wide lens is the perfect feature of Galaxy M10. Pictures do turn into something very real. Premium feel at a very affordable price. Good quality & trust of Samsung brand. Boycott cheap quality Chinese phones when you can get Samsung at such a low price..
Awesome phone best battery.
Good product.
Very good.
The display is just wow. It is almost bezel-less with a very small chin at the bottom. Also it is widevine L1 certified,which in this segment is mindblowing. The face unlock feature is very fast. Go for this device!.
Good-looking at first watch ,light weight,looks premium, average specs and good camera at this price range..
The M10 is yet another masterpiece designed by Samsung at a very affordable price and withmaximum features that has been provided.The Samsung M10 has got a very beautiful and sleek body which looks very elegant and beautiful andthe weight of the phone is quite light which makes it easy to handle and use and the size of the phoneis good which allows the user to effortlessly hold the phone.The screen is very beautiful with good colour quality and the size of the screen is very big and thenotch looks beautiful and also has the option to adjust the screen according to the notch andrequirement of the user.The camera at the low price range is very good and the wide angle mode is the best mode whichallows the user to capture wider images and hence getting a good picture. The autofocus is okay andtakes a while to autofocus but gives sharper images in the daylight and during night it is quite a task toclick the pictures. But overall the camera is quite good with many modes and the image quality.The Battery life is mind blowing with a battery capacity of 3500mah the phone continuously can beoperated for many hours and also gives quite and brilliant performance and there is no issue with thephone getting heated up and the battery saver mode helps to extend the battery with all the accuratebattery usage readings of all the applications.The dolby atmos sound also gives a good quality in the sound and the output given by the speaker isvery nice and it has a good sound quality compared to the phones at this low price range.Thus this phone is very good and a must buy and also good value for this price range..
Phone is awesome !!.
Worst mobile and worst Amazon service...I have purchased samsungM10... performance of camera is poor there is no fingerprint sensor ...screen qality is not up to that mark whatever mentioned in the specifications features are very less and cost is too much for that specifications ...and there is no return option plzz don't purchase it it's better to go for another brand .......display quality is also poor....
Mumy ko gift diya Valentine's peBahot acha lagaShe is very happy with this mobile phone.Touch screen is very goodCamera bhi acha haiWeight bhi jyada nahi hai or sirf fingerprint nahi hai but face unlocke hai ismeIt is very good mobile.
I can this new "SAMSUNG GALAXY M-10" was the much awaited phone from SAMSUNG! Almost I'm using it from past 20 days and i can say I am loving it. The phone display is great; look is awesome with sleek and crisp design. Great camera especially with ultra wide feature & smooth touch screen. Best in this price range so far. I took 3GB-32GB & Colour Ocean Blue really looks coool. The Battery life is good with 3400 mAh battery. It works decently well so that you don't have to charge your phone all the time. Everything is Okay, but the most needed earphone is not included in the box. Hope in future the customers can get with the box piece!.
Delivery was awesome but phone not too good. C1 is much better option..
Not satisfy.
Loud speakers are very bad,hanging the mobile with in 10 days.
Fast Delivery and Awsome MobileI'm trust only samsungThat's why I m purchasing Brand New Samsung Galaxy M10 its fabulous smartphone with gorgeous screen.
Zero stars.phone never successfully charged.returned after a torture from Amazon.1st request for technical support.technician came and found phone defective and issued power problem.then again request had to be made for pickup.pickup person came and demanded imei number.i gave him the phone which didn't start.he couldn't retrieve imei number neither from phone nor Bex as he was only a courier person who rudely declined the pickup and left.another pickup requested.this time again same story started by the pickup boy.can u imagine the nonsensical system where the pickup courier boy refuses to pickup the defective phone because it doesn't start.after a lot of hassles finally he was allowed by the officer in charge to take the worst phone ever Samsung Galaxy M10.
Major pros : Software optimisation  DisplayMajor cons : Speaker placement  Slippery.
everything is well but in the box earphone is not included so m not satisfy with this missing part.
The battery life of M10 is really long lasting. It is very light weighted. Easy to carry. It has infinite display which makes it more sleek in looking. Camera is clear and more effective in focusing the object. It is very smooth in usage. Its back camera is placed in the side which is a good thing as it doesn’t take much place. The same is with the front camera which makes the display infinite..
Writing review after 1 month use.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothly9) No leg in regular use10) Decent battery lifeCons:-1) The rear camera is so so2) Dose not have fast charging support.3) No Fingerprint scanner4) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support5) Not a PUBG Phone6) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)7) Bigger bottom bezel than M208) 1Amp Charger in the box (really sad).
Nice Product.
Supports dual 4G VoLTE as well as with a dedicated memory slot expandable upto 512GB. All storage needs are sorted.
It is amazing phone. i would like to recommend to purchase this phone. Samsung is big brand. In this price phone is very good.
Phone received today inside the box no charge n data cable available.
I purchased this phone for my mother. Samsung m10,'sDisplay - greatCamera-ok okFace recognition - goodBuild quality - bestBattery life - averageValue for Money smartphone for normal use. Haven't played any game on this. Just using is normal usage for calls and camera and some social media, with this usage battery last one day..
Phone From Samsung ?Really ?In 7999 ?First I thought that may be something like Emi starts from 7999 kr some exchange offer according to the phone's image and brand but there was its actual price !Really great phone with best display and camera quality.Samsung has first time done its good..
I like this phone better camera quality and best display.
Superb battery. Topped with battery optimization software from Samsung. Can easily last for a day, despite all the multitasking. Samsung is truly back!!.
Samsung has a history of making good looking devices, and Galaxy M10 is no exception. Even withthe polycarbonate body, Samsung has made it look so good that you can flaunt it without a cover. Interms of design, the glossy body feels much lighter and it is easy to grip. Having said that, both frontand back of M10 is prone to fingerprints/ smudges. In my case, I was still happy using the phonewithout the cover because it never felt delicate.This phone is totally adorable..
I have brought this phone for my mother. Please find my review below:Pros:1. The price is really affordable. This is the first reason I bought this phone.2. Very lightweight and easy to carry3. Display is Best. Full screen display is looking fabulous4. Sound is very good. I have tried video call audio call along with normal call all voice quality is very good.5. Connected it with my Mivi speaker which is also a gift to my mother. It just perform wonder.6. I have Redmi note 4 Pro and connected the same with Mivi speaker but sound quality was pathetic but when I connected this with Mivi Bluetooth speaker the performance is just awesome.7. If you are a music lover and wanted to connect the phone in Bluetooth speaker then go for it.8. Camera is good I will not say best but good. You will have standard filters like beauty , auto mode, funny stickers in this camera.you will also get an option for the Equalizer in the phone settings.9. Built quality also seems good.Cons:1. It is not a gaming phone.2. Camera quality is not best.3. The charging wire length is too short. Its literally too short.As a conclusion if you wanted to give a standard phone to a person who doesn't play a lot of game but using it for music playing, Video call then you must go for this one..
Nice phone. Camera is ok. Looks good. Think works fine.
worth it..very good quality..i love this brand..mobile so cute..i like this colour also camera...
Super....!!!Better Mi 6.
Got the phone late night yesterday, kept it for charge and its just doesn't switch on.When raised a complaint , a technician has to come and he will come only after 5 days !!!!! and then agent will come for replacement.Expected a lot from AMAZON and SAMSUNG. Budget phone doesn't mean Defect phone with no return Policy !!!!! ( do watch the video for the amazing feature).
Nice phone & nice looking.
Nice budget phone ever. Both camera super I like the selfie camera. Average performance  . Average battery. Good waterdrop notchdisplay.
The first thing that stands out about this phone is it’s screen. The edge-to-edge display is beautifully coupled with the size of 6.22”. The phone takes ‘UI experience’ to a whole new level with it’s super fast face recognition. Unlocking to opening an app takes barely a few seconds. With it’s fluid UI doing anything, be it documents, games or just some music everything is a breeze. With all the essential apps preloaded, you’re ready to go right out of the box. Coming to the camera, you’d be amazed at how vivid the pictures can get with the dual-camera wide angle setup. The edge to edge display and thoughtfully programmed UI, taking selfies even for someone with small hands is a cakewalk.This phone has special buity mode in camera that helps us taking a perfect selfie and picture the dual camera helps taking perfect short. Face ID keeps your data safe! This is a very spacious phone, the memory is expandable up to 512gb. Battery life is brilliant, battery last a full day. Screen size is the best thing for watching a movie, it gives the feel of watching a movie in a cinema hall . It is a full package with powerful processors. This phone is easy to carry and very user friendly, which is very good easy to use and handle. Sound quality is one of the lovely thing which gives you the feel of real life. Coming to the cost this is the most reasonable phone, which gives the full value of money and easy to affordable. This phone is a full package for a student!.
faulty model. Pathetic policies by Amazon now a days. no help to us. They are not providing ear phones with this pack. dont go.
Its a best phone..rear cam quality is awesome...battery life great....most imp thing is display is just amazing in this segment.....volume quaity is good....processor is fast ....for gaming its good phone....all the features are very good ....juat a amzing phone in this price....just one thing front cam quality is not so good bt its ok..
Considering this is Samsung's first try with a waterdrop much, this is am amazing phone. The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about Samsung M10, is the extreme light weight. It's super slick and thin which makes it easier and enjoyable to handle. Face recognition is a very nice and latestfeature considering the price of the phone. The Dolby Atmos system helps you listen better and enjoymusic better. The camera seems better than most other phones in the same price range. The cameraprovides a lot of unique features as well, like, live focus, panorama, and also a stickers features whichis great. The picture quality is also great. Also, with 3400 mAh battery, the phone has a long lastingbattery and can easily work for over 24 hours. The phone, overall, seems like a great catch for thegiven price..
Everything was good but main function was not good. When I call to other person then a sound raised and call get disconnected. It happens 6-7 timei out of 10 calls. I have ordered two handsets but both handsets have same problem. Kindly return this product. When I went to service centre, they says that problem coming with Airtel sim only. If if you want to use Samsung M10 then change your Airtel SIM to other service provider or use other SIM network Airtel will not support with this handset what kind of packing product I am very disappointed if you can return this just returned very poor service very bad service Amazon and Samsung also.
All things are great.

A mistake.My last few purchases have been Mi, Lava, Mi, Mi, Mi, Mi, Lenovo, Mi, Mi, Huawei, Mi, Mi, Mi, Samsung. I am not a fan of Mi, but whenever I went out for purchasing around Rs. 10K whereabouts, Mi scored. This time I was bored of Mi, bought a Samsung because, hey, it was a Samsung, it looked good and reviews seemed OK. It's been 3 days. The experience is bad. It's a 2GB RAM phone, but the lag is a mess. You have to wait for 3-5 seconds before the phone starts responding. I have always bought mid end phones, because i don't see a point in investing in the 8GB monsters. But the clock speed in Samsung M10 is 2012ish in terms of performance. The phone looks cool, feels good, but the performance is sub par. I am using a Huawei 8X myself with almost same specs, and the newly purchased Samsung M10 is a disappointment. Was expecting a far superior experience from a Samsung phone. Currently this phone works as bad as any of the white labelled phones you would find in Shenzhen. Going back to Mi for delivering just devices for the price. Good bye Samsung!!.
Good.
Berry good phone super display.
Samsung was slowly losing market in 10k phone market. This is the best phone to face the competition.Pros:--------1.  Fast face recognition2.  Screen resolution3.  Dual rear camera4.  Sound quality5.  Body to screen ratio ( especially notch )6.  Finally average priceCons:---------1.  No Headphones / Earphones given.2.  No back case given.  We need to purchase it seperately for Rs.200 to Rs.3003.  No screen guard given.  We need to purchase it seperately for Rs.100 to Rs.200..
Don't buy M10 bcoz the ringer speaker is back side of the phone, when phone is on the bed, table or inside of pocket we can't hearing ring tone..
Third grade experience with samsung. Ordered this 5 days back, received a damaged piece (manufacturing fault) replaced it, got another phone with display not working. I am shocked what the samsung company is up to, newly introduced M series so poorly built. Got 2 defective piece??? This is what happens when a company tries to build a cheaper phone to be in the competition..
Nice phone...nice display......nice looking..... battery backup so good......but packing so bad .....scratched......
Cemera quality is very bad, it's like VGA camera, very blur camera, phone is just like j4plus... only 1extra camera and 3gb,  3gb ram also very very slow , when u r in call mobile data will not work sometimes, not expected this in samsung, i called customer care he said yes in M10 series u cannot use mobile data in call, I said it works some time... care person is silent and unable to answer my question,Speaker is not working unable to hear other person voice,Mic is not working other side person also not able to hear my voice,Keypad not working properlyNumber 1 Worst phone.
Now getting an amazing phone in this budget is just like a dream come true.Amazing camera, an ever-lasting battery, infinity V-display and much more in 8000 bucks is the mostaffordable as well as amazing deal one can get.I am hell happy with this phone. It is a lot more than expectations! In love with its sleek design andocean blue back color adds more to charm of the device.Out of every amazing quality of this phone, the one quality which makes it outshine is its CAMERA!Dual camera (13+5MP) which clicks beautiful pictures, either it is a too bright place or too dull, yourpictures will be perfect! And not only the back camera, the rear camera is also amazing. It clicksrealistic pictures in all situations- too much of light or low light and even in no light. Believe me thecamera is miraculous, though all Samsung phones are known to have amazing camera quality but thisone just breaks all records in this price.And the 3400 mAh battery makes it the perfect pick becauselong-lasting battery and amazing camera is all what everyone wants in their phones!.
Team Samsung,Yet another demonstration of hidden terms & conditions which works in your favour. Kudos to the policy team.I bought M10 dated on 25/02/2019. The screen has gone blank. Visted customer service, was asked to call customer care for replacement.My question is straight.If i need a repair for the phone within 45 dayz of purchase hows the brand reliable.Question number 2.If my phone is open, its value depriciates immediately so how is it a profitable deal for me..When its ur faulty device and i just get a part replaced. The device looses its company sealing which is machine sealed to a human sealing it at the customer service making it more vulnerable to pollutant damages.Not happy Called customer service was advised to write an email as thats the voice service apparently and customer service says call call centre.No to this message as well i am expecting an automated message which will be handled by an ORM team, who would definitely wont be able to relate to my query and would simply ask me for a point of contact.Samsung as a brand is evolving and issue like this is impacting the whole experience. Ofcourse il do my bit, to make sure that i get the value of what i have paid , or invest the same amount to run a review campaign across platforms ,to impact the social proof for the brand .Understanding yours is a bog brand and url can knock me running another parallel campaign but even if i suceed convincing 6 buyers not to buy your i think i win here, and use yet would have to give me free part replacement.Thanks regardsUnhappy Customer whos wasting his precious weekend at ur customer serviceSamsung Global Consumer Rights Awareness The Indian Consumer Consumerforum Complaint.

Went for Repair with a Month..
It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it..
Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life.
Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video.
Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes..
There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product..
Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone..
Amazing mobile for best price happy with product.
Been using from the last few days, here are my first imperssions of the device.Pros:1. Display: The 6.2"" display is awesome. Samsung has again proved its excellence in the displays. Colors are sharp and viewing angles are good. The notch, which Samsung calls Infinity-V, looks way more appealing than the ugly notch in other devices in this price bracket.2. Camera: The 13MP camera is good for low-light shots. To top it all, the secondary camera of 5MP has an ultra-wide lens, which captures way more than a normal shot.3. Design: Phone seems sleek and light-weight. One handed use is also very easy.4. Face-Unlock: Face unlock is smooth and fast. There is also a v-shaped animation when you unlock the phone, which looks great.Cons:1. The 16GB storeage is a little less, but the memory card slot is a dedicated one, expandable upto 512GB, which more than makes up for it.Overall verdict: Terrific buy and value for money features in this segment.".
1. The Display is amazing at the price point2. Great online video experience3. Extra game launcher helps play games easily and without lags4. Many new features and better than Redmi Note 6 pro in terms of display.5. Slim phone handy.ConsCamera lags in low light.

Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes..
There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product..
Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone..
Amazing mobile for best price happy with product.
Been using from the last few days, here are my first imperssions of the device.Pros:1. Display: The 6.2"" display is awesome. Samsung has again proved its excellence in the displays. Colors are sharp and viewing angles are good. The notch, which Samsung calls Infinity-V, looks way more appealing than the ugly notch in other devices in this price bracket.2. Camera: The 13MP camera is good for low-light shots. To top it all, the secondary camera of 5MP has an ultra-wide lens, which captures way more than a normal shot.3. Design: Phone seems sleek and light-weight. One handed use is also very easy.4. Face-Unlock: Face unlock is smooth and fast. There is also a v-shaped animation when you unlock the phone, which looks great.Cons:1. The 16GB storeage is a little less, but the memory card slot is a dedicated one, expandable upto 512GB, which more than makes up for it.Overall verdict: Terrific buy and value for money features in this segment.".
1. The Display is amazing at the price point2. Great online video experience3. Extra game launcher helps play games easily and without lags4. Many new features and better than Redmi Note 6 pro in terms of display.5. Slim phone handy.ConsCamera lags in low light.
It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it..
Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life.

Pros:1.Looks stunning high end category.2.Battery is also powerful.3. Fast charging.Cons:1.Camera is not upto mark as it says 48MP it's like 8 Mp2. Storage & Memory statistics are confusing. Showing 900 mb free though I am not accessing much resources.3. Earphone slot given at down side which makes difficult to handle phone..
camera , battery , quality , grip ... and as i purchased the device in sale , i get 1000 cashback from the amazon , orded on today at 12 pm , and get the device on the same day at 2 pm .Thankyou amazon ..
Delivered within 24 hours.Looks awesome.Battery was 49% when I switched on..and after 2 hours of continuous use it is 42% now.Camera is awesome.Sound is loud.Display is amazing.Mine is Opal black one..
Bestest phone...Good battery lifeAmazing cameraFast processing.
after 5 days of uses:Camera 5/5Performances 5/5Display 5/5Battery 5/5Phone look 5/5User interface 5/5Sound 5/5awesome phone.
Phone is getting heat up.Phone rear camera quality is very poor.Speaker is also not good compare to its price.Phone body is not good..
I am adding video of unboxing this mobile. A only amazon is selling this mobile in great indian sale.Best part of this mobile is you ar not able to get any cheaper that this mobile for this configuration.Only one thing which I don't like in this mobile is it's little heavier than other Samsung mobile and also size is little big which is not user friendly..
45 MP camera is not upto the mark its looks like 16 mp focus.Else phone is ok.
very fast delivery by amazon..excellent phone....value for money at this price.
Nice product. the phone is not bulky even it contain 600 mah massive battery. this is the main plus point in this price point. the second advantage is the processor. Samsung has used the most advanced processor i this price range which can handle multiple complex situations except heavy games..
Excellent features, there is no con at all... i am enjoying all the way.. flagship mobile features with low budget price... go for it..
Disappointed...Pathetic camera focus.Wifi connectivity range also sUcKs.However, display and battery life are good..
Got delivered at 29 September 2019 9:45amLooks AwesomeGreat CameraWill update soon after thorough use.5 star for Best Delivery Service by Amazon India.Update: Battery is not Good it's draining very even you're not using your phone.Charging is also very slow.Not worth in this price segment.Realme 5pro is far better than this..
Battery  drains  quickly.
Amazon is always great compare to flipkart. Awesome service. Well Samsung M30s is no surprise is a lovely phone packed with all amazing features and monster battery back up. Looks good feels like magic.
Built quality is poor. Front camera is worst. Back camera doesn't look like 48megapixel. The product which I received has a back panel issue. Don't buy pearl white..
The camera quality is completely different than what is shown on Amazon.48MP camera clicks the picture clicked on 8MP camera..
Initially I was happy to get such a good hardware this price. But as soon as I inserted sim problem initiates. Very poor network reception however at the same time other mobiles with same network showed 50 percent better reception. And Amazon is refusing to consider this issue.As far as display is concerned it is one of the best display available in the market. Rear camera is superb but a bit disappointment is selfie camera. Battery life is good.Overall if you can afford to compromise with network or in your area if network problem is not there then you can go for this mobile worth at this price.
Detailed Review:Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have.Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS.Design, Touch, Look & Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect..
An awesome phone for the price paid. Got it delivered within few hours of placing the order. The M30s has a pretty interesting triple camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery which hopefully will last 2 days.I got a 10% discount on my SBI credit card and in addition to that I received Rs 1,000 cashback as Amazon Pay. Hence it would cost somewhere around 12K which is pretty surprising. I am very much impressed with Samsung.P.S. I am testing the camera, battery life and other stuff and I should be able to update this section shortly.By the way, the Super AMOLED screen is GORGEOUS.Update: The battery life is really amazing on this phone. Even after playing heavy games for long and watching videos with heavy usage, the battery lasts 2 days.The phone does get heated up little bit after during playing games like PubG & Asphalt 9..
Good.
Bought it for camera, 48+8+5 is just on paper, picture quality is just 5 MP, even a 2500 phone clicks better than this...front camera is super pathetic, it's 2mp.Don't buy this item guys. Go for other options.It's a worst choice. Wastage of money.PROs-Just one Pro ie 6000 mAh battery, but for that Battery backup You will not throw away Your hard earn 14000 rupees.CONs-1) CAMERA quality is big draw back. In 14k You will get Redmi Note 7pro, RealMe X,Xt with better camera quality than this.2) Panel is of low quality plastic which is giving crackling sound. Which is annoying and worrisome.3) Super Amoled screen is just a myth, no brightness adjustment, hence more battery consumption.4) One UI is pathetic. Not for old people in the house.5) The promises made by Samsung is not up to the mark, and it is not acceptable by a BRAND like Samsung.6) With this type of build quality, Camera and display, price should be at 8999 maximum.HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.PLEASE, DON'T BUY this phone, otherwise You will regret later.Writing this review after using for a Week..
My Idea Sim cards are not working in both the slots. I am receiving notification as "mm Sim not Allowed". I contacted for product return but they are not accepting my return. I am totally frustrated now..
From finger print , camera to battery life every thing is more than as expected in this price range. Beyond  this shape , color, speed every thing is very very good . Every 5star is less if their is option of 7star I give that to..
The camera quality  is disgusting,  and It doesn't fit the description of 48mp.Even when there are no apps running, I am getting only 2.8GB usable ram.When I am asking for a phone replacement for defective piece, associates deny it by stating that we don't have any proof for product being defective.I am a prime member since a long time and this is how they treat their old customers..
It is really a monster.  Looks are awesome battery is amazing 6000mah . It's super slow motion feature is reallly amazing .Totally worthy every single penny. I am buying it in 11500 ..Over all reviewsCamera 5/5Performances 5/5Display 5/5Battery 5/5Phone look 4/5Sound(very good sound quality) 5/5Over all superb phone..
Best phone with this budget. Best battery..
Battery backup highlightCamera also superMy suggestion for this price very good option.
Wonderful phone at such a reasonable price . The only drawback is that there aare no earphones with the phone , otherwise the phone is great, with wonderful speed to start with  lovely display.
Good.
Cameras  Quality not good both Front and Back. Screen Quality also not good..
First impressions...*1-week update added.For now, I can only compare the M30s with the Asus Zenfone 5z and a OnePlus 3T, both of which 'were' flagships of the respective brands. In the past I have used Motorolas exclusively. I 'was' a big Motorola fan and consider stock android as the best user experience on a smartphone.Pros1. Display 5/5 – Big, Beautiful but more importantly a well-calibrated one. It's easily better than the Oppo and Vivo AMOLED implementations, simply because Samsung has taken the pains to somehow calibrate each unit.2. Ergonomics 5/5 – You are unlikely to call this device bulky or cumbersome for one-handed use because of the 20:9 aspect ratio, excellent weight management and OneUI optimisations for one-handed use.3. Battery Life 4/5 – 11-12hrs SoT for me i.e. 1.5days use. Frankly, it's a bit disappointing considering that my older Motorolas gave 6-8hrs on 13nm architecture SoCs, had 2,700-3,000 mah batteries and had less efficient LCD panels. At 6,000mah it should've given close to 14hr SoT, for my use-case.4. Performance 5/5 – Very fast app opening speeds! Compares very well with the Snapdragon 821 powered and phenomenally well optimized OnePlus 3T. Falls short of the Asus 5z, which is a no-brainer. RAM management is decent too, of the 4GB RAM I tend to have 1.5GB free. 8-10 non-game apps are typically always in memory. UFS 2.1 is a Big leap for those of us upgrading from eMMC storage. This is particularly noticeable in both app opening speeds as well as in the gallery app where Images and Video thumbnails load instantly. Deleting is also super fast!5. Touch Response 5/5 – Fast, precise, with low latency. Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience.6. One UI 3.5/5 – It's difficult to rate it because I've ALWAYS used stock android. And although I enjoy the add-ons OneUI comes with I also miss the clean, fluid, conflict-free experience that stock android is known for. Mind you, this is FAR better than the Chinese ROMs that I tried out in offline stores; ColorOS, FuntouchOS, MIUI and even ZenUI. OneUI is less obtrusive, cleaner, has no ads and is easier to use one-handed. OneUI isn't flawless, I have experienced app crashes (Tata Sky and Palabre) on when I never faced any issues with them with my previous phones. It does ship with bloatware, asks for a LOT of permissions, has unrequired 'suggestions'. Though all of that can be shut down within 5mins. What you do have to put up with is – stutters. You see them from time to time. It may not be a deal breaker, but yes  it's clearly a step-down from stock android. For me, if Stock android is 100... Oxygen OS gets a 100 too, One UI gets 85 and ZenUI gets 75. The other Chinese skins (MIUI, ColorOS, FuntouchOS) are definitely far more heavily modified and further away from the core experience android is known for.7. Call Quality and Cellular Reception 5/5 – I actually placed calls from all the weak spots at home where signals drop to just 1 bar. Thankfully the M30s doesn't drop signals more than other phones that I've used in fact it's a shade better than the Motorolas I had previously. It's not a mind-blowing signal-catcher either, but yes I do get internet on my Jio sim where sometimes the other phones would struggle. Call quality was Good too, slightly better than the 5z but just short of the OnePlus 3T. Compared to 5z, the sound is sharper (but never sibilant) as opposed to being slightly more muffled and recessed in the upper frequencies.8. Reliability/Peace of mind and a vast Service network.Cons1. Build quality 3/5 – Its a unibody plastic build but a rather flimsy grade of plastic has been used. You can feel and at times also hear the plastic flex next to the power button and the fingerprint scanner. The button themselves have a short travel and satisfactory tactility. Most Chinese phones (which I checked out at offline stores) offer a better build and have Gorilla Glass too, which is rated higher than Schott or Asahi's dragontail (used here), especially in terms of drop protection. For scratch resistance this should be ok, hopefully.2. Charging performance 2/5 – 2hrs 30mins is very 2015 (6,000 mah, I know). Perhaps an 18w charger helps shave off 15mins or so?, I'll give an update on that. What's more irksome is that if you are using the phone while charging it significantly slows down charging speed (3.5hrs or so!), this is a difference you can't miss. It does not happen on the other devices I have at home, to this extent.3. Cameras 2/5 – I've used SLRs/DSLRs for over 2 decades so I understand a thing or two. Which also means I don't expect phones, especially at this price point to do great. Even with toned down expectations the cameras are rather poor. The '48mp' Detail is absent, dynamic range mediocre and there's over sharpening/ringing too, though colours are thankfully more natural than I expected from Samsung. Frankly, the '48mp', '64mp', '108mp' number dropping these days is wayyy deep into gimmicky territory because these things at best may be a tad better than older 12/16mp modules, when implemented right. I can only say that it's nowhere near the 12mp primary camera on the Asus 5z (especially with gCam, at night). What's good is the Video Stability & super slow motion feature. Stabilization is actually better than the other two, especially surprising if you know that both 5z & 3t have OIS, this does not! I will update this section if/when I can compare it against its class.4. LTE speeds over Jio 2.5/5 – A bit disappointing actually. Here it's more like the 6-series from 2018. Even with UFS 2.1, app downloading over Jio was very similar to the older phones I've used. Nowhere close to the 3t, leave alone 5z. Mind you, the Snapdragon 7-series is FAR closer to the 835/845 on this category.5. Heapdhone quality 3/5 – I'm not a hardcore audiophile but I've spent a small fortune on audio over the years. The m30s has a lively presentation with good dynamics and respectable detail but the frequency response isn't flat. The bass is clearly boosted and the upper frequencies are muted. Its definitely a flavoured sound unlike my Moto G5 Plus which had phenomenally clean audio and superb stereo separation (price no bar!), with my Audio Technica ath-m50, Soundmagic e10c and Beyerdynamic Byron I never had a complaint. The M30s has better detail for sure but it's a more central ('in your head'), less neutral sound. The Hidizs Sonata HD is a good option if you want a solid upgrade for around 2-2.5k, if you want to go cheaper still try the pixel Type-C to 3.5mm dongle there's a lot of praise for it and it's available for just 1.3k or so.6. Lack of XDA love – The XDA community showers tons of love to Snapdragon powered phones in making them cleaner/slicker/customizable with Custom ROMs because Exynos is locked out by Samsung :(7. Speaker performance – Not bad but certainly nothing above mediocre. At least it's not that ear piercing, shrill sound that some models at this price point are plagued with and its loud too. OnePlus 3T has a significantly cleaner, tighter output. I won't even bother drawing a comparison with the 5z ;)8. Android Update track record – I found that Samsung has one of the slowest update speeds, 6-10 months after official release (if you're lucky!). Which probably means no Android 10 until March 2020 :( May be things change in the OneUI era?First impressions, a full 5/5.I'll update with Long-term findings.--- 7th October, 2019. 1-week update ---One UI experience.So I've begun to appreciate OneUI in its entirety. The stutters have reduced, I guess when the phone was new there was a lot happening in the background. Besides, some of the intrusive stuff was still running which I've since force stopped and disabled.The features that I think are great additions over stock android...1. Open in pop-up view – True multitasking! A huge plus in my book.2. Always on display – A great feature to have on an AMOLED display and a 6,000mah battery.3. The screenshot toolbar – it's well designed and the added functionality is much appreciated.4. Gesture based quick app switcher – A neat and well implemented way of quickly moving through apps5. 9-band Equaliser – The presets and the fully customizable graphic equaliser have system wide effect over audio, a very underrated feature.6. Dark/Night mode – Android 10 will bring this at the system level. But it doesn't hurt to have it at some level already, even if its only for the system apps.What I think are half-baked or unrequired features...1. Aggressive auto brightness – The ambient light sensor almost always chooses a brighter than required output.2. Assistive touch – 2 pages to swipe through is a good idea but most of it is of absolutely no use! And there's no option to customise it either.3. Screenshot shortcuts – They've given 3 bad ways of doing it. And the award for the worst experience goes to... "Palm swipe"! Not only is it inconsistent but also senselessly cumbersome. 3-finger swipe on my Motorola worked flawlessly and was faster too. I tried the Assistive touch but that always-on-screen button soon became an eyesore. So I ended up with the Power button + Volume down key :(All my other 'first impressions' remain unchanged.A piece of advice for prospective buyers:If the negative reviews confuse you, please understand this – The negative reviews are by people who have either...1. Bought the device for the wrong reasons.2. Or have unrealistic expectations from a device that was available under 12k, at launch.3. Or have a genuine issue with a bad unit (a very small percentage).4. Or are paid trolls!Most of the negative reviews seem to fall in category 1. & 2.The USPs of this device are...1. A Very Very good display – It's accurate, most cheap AMOLED sporting devices are not. Which is why you get unnatural skin tones and unrealistic greens/reds with some other mid-range phones (Mi A3, Realme XT, Vivo z1x etc.)2. One UI – A FAR cleaner alternative to Chinese skins/ROMs3. Excellent battery life – 11/12hrs of SoT!4. Fast app opening speeds and RAM management5. Reliability!I ordered a case but it hasn't been delivered yet.Despite that there's not one scratch on the display or the back!You will be disappointed if you are buying this device particularly for...1. Build quality2. or Camera performance3. or Charging speed4. or Superfast updates5. or for making NFC payments (via Google pay or Samsung pay). Though not many outlets accept this in India, at least not in Tier 2 cities, as of 2019.Also remember that all other alternatives will come with their own set of drawbacks too.Can't have it all, not in 2019 at least.Rating unchanged, fully satisfied "for the price paid!".
This is not orginal phone this is made in india and not upto the mark as samsung . camera is not good quality and not mark upto 48MP  and battery is not good.
Good Product and amazing fast delivery by Amazon within 2 hour only.
Received M30s today and really  a great buy . Picture quality is too good . Can update more a week later on the perfomance. Dolby Atmos really rocks . Body build is better than usual SAMSUNG mobile. Perfomance is fine in my 6GB ram variant . Battery backup seems fine , hardly 5% is utilized for normal usage with 24×7 location,4G/ wifi and limited calls .The battery finally stood for 4 day for my limited use specified above. Overall perfomance is good and acceptable..
Value for money for this Smartphone & Thank you AMAZON.
One of the best Display Ever. One of the best Battery Ever. One of the Supperb Camera is Ever. Processor is Mindblowing.sAMOLED is Worth it. Exynose 9611 is Worth it. 6000mAh battery is worth it. 48MP Camera  is Worth it.ONE OF THE BEST BUDGET SAMSUNG MOBILE EVER..
Front Camera should be little better remaining all features are EXCELLENT!!!More than my expectations!!!.
Simply fabulous deal....Complete budget phone with all what u need.1. Good camera- Yes ( wide angle, depth)2. Battery- Yes3. User Experience -thumbsup..4. Looks premium.5. Simply amazing.6. Good Brand- Yes7. synchronized- Well will now after 7 days of usage.6. Processor Good..7. Customer service is a plus point ofcourse.8. It's "The best deal" in this price segment.Must buy.....
SD card sometimes  un mounting  automatically.. we have to restart the phone to bring contents  in sd card.
Probably  the only con about this smartphone is its camera quality, specifically  that of the front camera. The selfies are strictly average, although you can make them work with some basic editing on Snapseed or Lightroom, but they lack detail. The images are soft. Also, there's no support for GCam out of the box, so that makes it worse. But you definitely can make them work, they aren't that bad.But other than that, this is a really great deal. I've heard people complaining  about creaking noises in the back panel, but personally, I haven't noticed any such thing. I even tried pressing the back panel hard to just see, but it seemed  pretty  solid to me. Apart from that, the battery is obviously  outstanding and so is the display. The UI is smooth and snappy as well, no lag noticed. However, I am not a gamer, so I don't know how would that turn out.Overall, I think if you can settle in the camera area a bit, it's a great deal, considering you also get Samsung's  excellent  after sales experience and support..
Well, this is another classic example like how our much hyped cinemas/movie do (Flop). I really thought Samsung is doing something to get back in the mid segment market with a quality product, but doesn't look like it. The only positive in this mobile is the battery, but it's too early to comment on it. Camera is not upto the mark, no gorila glass protection and more importantly this has sim detection issue especially Vodafone and idea. Bought this mobile but unable to use it. I would recommend Redmi phones over Samsung..
Camera quality is very bad. Blur in all photos. When zooming any pic, it cracks. If compared to redmi 7 pro camera, redmi is much better.
Product is very poorCamera is the worstDisplay is poorHitting issueHitting like blastingSo carefully buy at youre own risk.
I do not received Samsung m30s phone with phone back cover, flip cover and screen gtad cover... Please deliver my phone cover and screen cover....
Poor camera and performance and I'm unable to return the product. Battery heating issue.
Product is found damaged. Phone not getting Boot / Start.Need replacement.
nice battery and camera.
Received today best buy at given price..
I received my Samsung m30s , this phone is looking nice , camera quality is good , but amazon packing is poor.
Very good product at an affordable price , for Students it is a MUST, if you don't use your phone heavily consider going for Samsung Galaxy M10s It's almost the same features lesser price, but those who wants to push the limits just go for this phone 200% worth the price.Use tempered glass and back cover for protection, as the phone doesn't come with Gorilla glass 5 protection and sAMOLED screens are very delicate and costly.Very much satisfied, thank you amazon.Thanks for reading ; ).
It's a scame I am facing problem since day 1 I am facing battery problem and when I tried to contact Amazon and tried to replace product they said that will tell technicians to check your phone and then my phone's replace date is 10th Oct and I am complaining everyday and still they are not replying me and telling me that we will solve it not date is gone and I am trying to call them they are not even picking up the call ....... I will not buy anything form Amazon I hate this ... Amazon sucks....
mine is opal black and it look amazing ,user interface is better than all other phones.rear camera is good (all you need is good light and steady hand) in low light i would recommend of using flash (it takes more detail),front camera average in low lighting and good in natural light.you can play pubg on HD ultra smoothly, and hdr with constant 30+fps.the more interesting function is AR emojies (must try),& pubg works excellent after update.Massive Battery is hard to drain completely..
Mst phone hain.
Extremely bad network strength..Camera quality is not so good as it claims 48MP.  Also, mobile is heating up after few minutes of call. Disappointed from Samsung..
Delivered within two daysLooking awesomeBattery is really monstrousCamera is awesome and picture quality is also goodSound is goodDisplay is amazing..
no ear phonetouch not properslow speednot good quality.
This is good mobile battery 2 day working and camera is good wide angled so much good.
Display battery ok but  camera not goodDisine super light weight.
Product was good.Value for money but one thing I don't like is Samsung have not provided 15/18W charger in the box.Battery performance was superbYou can easily differ the pictures taken using wide angle camera.
Review of Samsung M30s (4GB variant ):I am pretty much sure that many people might have already purchased this device during Amazon festive season like me, later thought of writing review or rating or Checking what others purchaser thinks about this device, or if you are a person who is looking to purchase this device after Amazon festival season or after seeing this review then you have done a good job (even though you might have lost some perks, if any), So, that I can let you know certain things which people obviously miss out in seeing YouTube review videos.I hope you have time to read my review, So let me confirm to the scope of this review; I am not going speak about camera, display and other common stuffs, as many YouTubers have done good job in those areas and you can check out any video in the YouTube either English or Hindi or regional language of yours, they seems to be good. I personally gone through most of them they are all seems to speak in same aspect,  so, if you consider my suggestion you can check any one of them to know basic info, out of those videos; I thought most informative was Geekranjit and C4tech unboxing video.Let’s start out Pros and Cons which you may feel informative, I am writing this after using this device exhaustively for 2 days;Pros;1. I was afraid to buy Samsung device for the reason that, it comes with bloatware (Think as Useless apps). Thanks to Samsung One UI which has less apps and you can uninstall most of the apps including some of google apps which you don’t use. But be care full while setting up device; ensure you uncheck all unnecessary permission to avoid ads and bloatware. But funny thing is you can’t uninstall Netflix and Facebook, though you can disable them. (Approx. you will be having 12 to 15apps which you can’t disable or uninstall)2. Out of 4 GB ram you get 1.7 GB ram free and out of 64GB rom you get ~53GB (approx.) free out of box.3. Samsung one UI is good in ram management (that helps apps running in background and ease access all time you need)4. If you enable developer option you can see much customization, like;• Reducing animation (Helps in speeding up device)• Auto Night mode( which seems to be not working right now but after future updates bug will be fixed)• Limiting the background process• Under battery management option you can even set sleeping mode for desired apps.(For instance; I don’t want to see ads from true caller, I use it only to search unknown numbers therefore I put this app under sleep mode so it automatically force stop the app once I am done with my job so that It can’t send me notification)5. Battery management seems to be good and there is emergency mode to save your battery from draining.6. With respect to chipset it comes equipped with Exynos 9611 utilizes 10nm processor (Think like lesser nm means better speed and good performance, for instance Oneplus 7 pro utilizes 7nm so it is superfast). I personally compared this chip-set with snapdragon 712 (Used in Realme XT, Realme 5pro, other competitive devices) as per official website spec of these both seems to be same there is no exceptional differences, however as per some website they claim exynos 9611 is better than snapdragon 712 and other claims vice versa(Opposite). I do checked gaming review of both chip-set, both seems to be performing at par, worth to note again that Samsung one UI is boosting a lot this chipset for best performance. However, heating and lag was observed with the same chipset used in Samsung A50s while playing PUBG in high graphics. However, many gamer while playing PUBG on this device has suggested it’s good. (Check out gaming review of Gizmoddict for Samsung A50s {since same chipset} in YouTube for more information)Cons:1. Phone warms up little bit while doing multitasking you will be able feel near rare camera. (depends on app you use)2. Durability seems to be very bad you need to be much careful with this device, I am not going take any chance in it but still you can check out Gupta information system video with respect to durability test of Samsung m30s in YouTube.3. For some strange reason my songs which are in ogg format are not recognized as songs by music player in this device so I converted my entire song list to mp3 using some third party app.4. Auto brightness seems to be not adjusting automatically, I don’t know whether it is a bug or due to screen guard and I think in case of bug future updates may fix this bugs.5. In Samsung official page under support tab, I noticed this model will receive quarterly security updates, which is worth noting.6. Before making purchase of this device I noticed in some newspaper (I think Indian express) that  this device will receive Android Q update and Samsung is planning to give much support for this new M series device ( Don’t laugh because I noted in con section, since it just reported not guaranteed)(If you have any doubts about this device or need specific info you can comment or ask in Q&A section I would love to help you out, if I know).
Phone is heating too much within 10 to 15minutes of normal using. Camera quality is very poor. Shutter speed  also slow..
Awesome Battery life.
Never expected this kinda inferior product from the Big brand like Samsung.Here are pros and consPros:-1. Screen (at 11.6K price)2. Battery (6K mAh though will perform like 4K mAh due to software issue I guess coz hardware has 6K capacity) Cons :-1. Camera Sucks2. Performance Choppy even in normal uses not talking about gaming3. GPU Sucks very slow performance in the gaming4. Heating issues while playing gamesWouldn't recommend any one to buy this phone.
Excellent.
Camera quality Disappointed front camera,  not clear images 16 mp like 8 mp, phone  heavy waite hand on , not purchase camera lovers.
Body material is very worst.
Not impressed with the camera. I don't find the "48 mp" camera to be any good..

Build quality is patheticCell reception is badBattery drains like hellTotally regrettable purchace.
I bought the Samsung M30s on 28th Sept. But I am highly disappointed with this phone due to the following reasons:1. Camera quality is pathetic ( i don't think it's 48 MP)2. The phone didn't read my sim...(i used multiple Sims).
Worst..heating problem.

Amazon selling LIE ...mobile heated during call and charging the phone..camera quality is very bad..please don't buy this mobile.
Everyone knows pros like battery, screen etc etc but there are many cons to1. Ram available is around 1.5 GB which becomes 800mb without much use2. Wifi speed is less, I have 50mbps plan and my m30s showing 30mbps whereas  my moto z play showing 48mbps3. Record time for super slow motion video is 2-3 sec only4. Camera quality is ok ok only5. Phones support max 15watt charge only.
Its my First Purchase of Samsung Galaxy Smartphone, its M30s. Previously used other brands like Motorola, Nokia, Xiaomi, Vivo.As it was Global Brand, I trusted and Expected more from the Specs advertised or mentioned, But from 1st day of delivery i found it was Defective. Yes Defective Product delivered by Amazon India.Coming to Device Review :- Only Display sAmoled with Full HD+ was good, and some how The one ui was good.Battery backup was like 4000 mah only, processor heats a lot up-to 46 degree. And consumes more power, power hungry processor, so battery lasts less time.Product was Feel like cheap because poor build quality, makes back panel and sides crackling sound.Even One ui having ads, yes but it can be stopped when initial setup of device to not to receive any marketing information unlike Xiaomi.Cameras also Above Average, front camera is below Average only.Overall Not expected from Samsung Brand.For the Display Only I am giving 2 stars, rest was a crap, because of Overheating of Device when Using Normally without Gaming, and Battery drains a lot in idle also..
5 stars for delivery as I got it within 24 hours of placing order. Working awesome and smooth! I will update this review after 15 days of usage..
Phone is reasonably good at the price 12699rs. display quality is very good. Black color is decent with little green mixed in the corner. Phone could have been little handy in size apart from that back side panel is little cheaper in terms of touch nd feel. But can't blame it bcz of its price point..
Camera was not at all worthy of even 1000 rsElse everything is unbelievable extraordinaryCamera disappointed me.
very dispointed with camera..its not like 48 mp..front camera  is also very poor as compared my Y1 front camera (16mp).. prefered it only because of its 48 mp camera and brand name SAMSUNG..but huge disppointment...
First of all I would like to mention the battery life of SAMSUNG GALAXY M30s , it's superb no need of power bank you can use it for one and half day when fully charged . And the SUPER AMOLED display is awesome. The most important thing is the CAMERA quality 48 MP is also superb as it's giving an equal performance when compared to DSLR cameras . Everything in M30s are superb. Mobile is very comfortable while holding, the curves are really nice that's helping to feel comfortable. Over all it's a very nice mobile. And thanks amazon for "GREAT INDIAN SALE".SUPERB MOBILE..

Useless samsung M30s mobile.
Pros:1.Looks stunning high end category.2.Battery is also powerful.3. Fast charging.Cons:1.Camera is not upto mark as it says 48MP it's like 8 Mp2. Storage & Memory statistics are confusing.

Nice product. the phone is not bulky even it contain 600 mah massive battery. this is the main plus point in this price point. the second advantage is the processor. Samsung has used the most advanced processor i this price range which can handle multiple complex situations except heavy games..
Excellent features, there is no con at all... i am enjoying all the way.. flagship mobile features with low budget price... go for it..
Disappointed...Pathetic camera focus.Wifi connectivity range also sUcKs.However, display and battery life are good..
Got delivered at 29 September 2019 9:45amLooks AwesomeGreat CameraWill update soon after thorough use.5 star for Best Delivery Service by Amazon India.Update: Battery is not Good it's draining very even you're not using your phone.Charging is also very slow.Not worth in this price segment.Realme 5pro is far better than this..
Battery  drains  quickly.
Amazon is always great compare to flipkart. Awesome service. Well Samsung M30s is no surprise is a lovely phone packed with all amazing features and monster battery back up. Looks good feels like magic.
Built quality is poor. Front camera is worst. Back camera doesn't look like 48megapixel. The product which I received has a back panel issue. Don't buy pearl white..
The camera quality is completely different than what is shown on Amazon.48MP camera clicks the picture clicked on 8MP camera..
Initially I was happy to get such a good hardware this price. But as soon as I inserted sim problem initiates. Very poor network reception however at the same time other mobiles with same network showed 50 percent better reception. And Amazon is refusing to consider this issue.As far as display is concerned it is one of the best display available in the market. Rear camera is superb but a bit disappointment is selfie camera. Battery life is good.Overall if you can afford to compromise with network or in your area if network problem is not there then you can go for this mobile worth at this price.
Detailed Review:Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have.Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS.Design, Touch, Look & Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect..
An awesome phone for the price paid. Got it delivered within few hours of placing the order. The M30s has a pretty interesting triple camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery which hopefully will last 2 days.I got a 10% discount on my SBI credit card and in addition to that I received Rs 1,000 cashback as Amazon Pay. Hence it would cost somewhere around 12K which is pretty surprising. I am very much impressed with Samsung.P.S. I am testing the camera, battery life and other stuff and I should be able to update this section shortly.By the way, the Super AMOLED screen is GORGEOUS.Update: The battery life is really amazing on this phone. Even after playing heavy games for long and watching videos with heavy usage, the battery lasts 2 days.The phone does get heated up little bit after during playing games like PubG & Asphalt 9..
Good.
Bought it for camera, 48+8+5 is just on paper, picture quality is just 5 MP, even a 2500 phone clicks better than this...front camera is super pathetic, it's 2mp.Don't buy this item guys. Go for other options.It's a worst choice. Wastage of money.PROs-Just one Pro ie 6000 mAh battery, but for that Battery backup You will not throw away Your hard earn 14000 rupees.CONs-1) CAMERA quality is big draw back. In 14k You will get Redmi Note 7pro, RealMe X,Xt with better camera quality than this.2) Panel is of low quality plastic which is giving crackling sound. Which is annoying and worrisome.3) Super Amoled screen is just a myth, no brightness adjustment, hence more battery consumption.4) One UI is pathetic. Not for old people in the house.5) The promises made by Samsung is not up to the mark, and it is not acceptable by a BRAND like Samsung.6) With this type of build quality, Camera and display, price should be at 8999 maximum.HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.PLEASE, DON'T BUY this phone, otherwise You will regret later.Writing this review after using for a Week..
My Idea Sim cards are not working in both the slots. I am receiving notification as "mm Sim not Allowed". I contacted for product return but they are not accepting my return. I am totally frustrated now..
From finger print , camera to battery life every thing is more than as expected in this price range. Beyond  this shape , color, speed every thing is very very good . Every 5star is less if their is option of 7star I give that to..
The camera quality  is disgusting,  and It doesn't fit the description of 48mp.Even when there are no apps running, I am getting only 2.8GB usable ram.When I am asking for a phone replacement for defective piece, associates deny it by stating that we don't have any proof for product being defective.I am a prime member since a long time and this is how they treat their old customers..
It is really a monster.  Looks are awesome battery is amazing 6000mah . It's super slow motion feature is reallly amazing .Totally worthy every single penny. I am buying it in 11500 ..Over all reviewsCamera 5/5Performances 5/5Display 5/5Battery 5/5Phone look 4/5Sound(very good sound quality) 5/5Over all superb phone..
Best phone with this budget. Best battery..
Battery backup highlightCamera also superMy suggestion for this price very good option.
Wonderful phone at such a reasonable price . The only drawback is that there aare no earphones with the phone , otherwise the phone is great, with wonderful speed to start with  lovely display.
Good.
Cameras  Quality not good both Front and Back. Screen Quality also not good..
First impressions...*1-week update added.For now, I can only compare the M30s with the Asus Zenfone 5z and a OnePlus 3T, both of which 'were' flagships of the respective brands. In the past I have used Motorolas exclusively. I 'was' a big Motorola fan and consider stock android as the best user experience on a smartphone.Pros1. Display 5/5 – Big, Beautiful but more importantly a well-calibrated one. It's easily better than the Oppo and Vivo AMOLED implementations, simply because Samsung has taken the pains to somehow calibrate each unit.2. Ergonomics 5/5 – You are unlikely to call this device bulky or cumbersome for one-handed use because of the 20:9 aspect ratio, excellent weight management and OneUI optimisations for one-handed use.3. Battery Life 4/5 – 11-12hrs SoT for me i.e. 1.5days use. Frankly, it's a bit disappointing considering that my older Motorolas gave 6-8hrs on 13nm architecture SoCs, had 2,700-3,000 mah batteries and had less efficient LCD panels. At 6,000mah it should've given close to 14hr SoT, for my use-case.4. Performance 5/5 – Very fast app opening speeds! Compares very well with the Snapdragon 821 powered and phenomenally well optimized OnePlus 3T. Falls short of the Asus 5z, which is a no-brainer. RAM management is decent too, of the 4GB RAM I tend to have 1.5GB free. 8-10 non-game apps are typically always in memory. UFS 2.1 is a Big leap for those of us upgrading from eMMC storage. This is particularly noticeable in both app opening speeds as well as in the gallery app where Images and Video thumbnails load instantly. Deleting is also super fast!5. Touch Response 5/5 – Fast, precise, with low latency. Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience.6. One UI 3.5/5 – It's difficult to rate it because I've ALWAYS used stock android. And although I enjoy the add-ons OneUI comes with I also miss the clean, fluid, conflict-free experience that stock android is known for. Mind you, this is FAR better than the Chinese ROMs that I tried out in offline stores; ColorOS, FuntouchOS, MIUI and even ZenUI. OneUI is less obtrusive, cleaner, has no ads and is easier to use one-handed. OneUI isn't flawless, I have experienced app crashes (Tata Sky and Palabre) on when I never faced any issues with them with my previous phones. It does ship with bloatware, asks for a LOT of permissions, has unrequired 'suggestions'. Though all of that can be shut down within 5mins. What you do have to put up with is – stutters. You see them from time to time. It may not be a deal breaker, but yes  it's clearly a step-down from stock android. For me, if Stock android is 100... Oxygen OS gets a 100 too, One UI gets 85 and ZenUI gets 75. The other Chinese skins (MIUI, ColorOS, FuntouchOS) are definitely far more heavily modified and further away from the core experience android is known for.7. Call Quality and Cellular Reception 5/5 – I actually placed calls from all the weak spots at home where signals drop to just 1 bar. Thankfully the M30s doesn't drop signals more than other phones that I've used in fact it's a shade better than the Motorolas I had previously. It's not a mind-blowing signal-catcher either, but yes I do get internet on my Jio sim where sometimes the other phones would struggle. Call quality was Good too, slightly better than the 5z but just short of the OnePlus 3T. Compared to 5z, the sound is sharper (but never sibilant) as opposed to being slightly more muffled and recessed in the upper frequencies.8. Reliability/Peace of mind and a vast Service network.Cons1. Build quality 3/5 – Its a unibody plastic build but a rather flimsy grade of plastic has been used. You can feel and at times also hear the plastic flex next to the power button and the fingerprint scanner. The button themselves have a short travel and satisfactory tactility. Most Chinese phones (which I checked out at offline stores) offer a better build and have Gorilla Glass too, which is rated higher than Schott or Asahi's dragontail (used here), especially in terms of drop protection. For scratch resistance this should be ok, hopefully.2. Charging performance 2/5 – 2hrs 30mins is very 2015 (6,000 mah, I know). Perhaps an 18w charger helps shave off 15mins or so?, I'll give an update on that. What's more irksome is that if you are using the phone while charging it significantly slows down charging speed (3.5hrs or so!), this is a difference you can't miss. It does not happen on the other devices I have at home, to this extent.3. Cameras 2/5 – I've used SLRs/DSLRs for over 2 decades so I understand a thing or two. Which also means I don't expect phones, especially at this price point to do great. Even with toned down expectations the cameras are rather poor. The '48mp' Detail is absent, dynamic range mediocre and there's over sharpening/ringing too, though colours are thankfully more natural than I expected from Samsung. Frankly, the '48mp', '64mp', '108mp' number dropping these days is wayyy deep into gimmicky territory because these things at best may be a tad better than older 12/16mp modules, when implemented right. I can only say that it's nowhere near the 12mp primary camera on the Asus 5z (especially with gCam, at night). What's good is the Video Stability & super slow motion feature. Stabilization is actually better than the other two, especially surprising if you know that both 5z & 3t have OIS, this does not! I will update this section if/when I can compare it against its class.4. LTE speeds over Jio 2.5/5 – A bit disappointing actually. Here it's more like the 6-series from 2018. Even with UFS 2.1, app downloading over Jio was very similar to the older phones I've used. Nowhere close to the 3t, leave alone 5z. Mind you, the Snapdragon 7-series is FAR closer to the 835/845 on this category.5. Heapdhone quality 3/5 – I'm not a hardcore audiophile but I've spent a small fortune on audio over the years. The m30s has a lively presentation with good dynamics and respectable detail but the frequency response isn't flat. The bass is clearly boosted and the upper frequencies are muted. Its definitely a flavoured sound unlike my Moto G5 Plus which had phenomenally clean audio and superb stereo separation (price no bar!), with my Audio Technica ath-m50, Soundmagic e10c and Beyerdynamic Byron I never had a complaint. The M30s has better detail for sure but it's a more central ('in your head'), less neutral sound. The Hidizs Sonata HD is a good option if you want a solid upgrade for around 2-2.5k, if you want to go cheaper still try the pixel Type-C to 3.5mm dongle there's a lot of praise for it and it's available for just 1.3k or so.6. Lack of XDA love – The XDA community showers tons of love to Snapdragon powered phones in making them cleaner/slicker/customizable with Custom ROMs because Exynos is locked out by Samsung :(7. Speaker performance – Not bad but certainly nothing above mediocre. At least it's not that ear piercing, shrill sound that some models at this price point are plagued with and its loud too. OnePlus 3T has a significantly cleaner, tighter output. I won't even bother drawing a comparison with the 5z ;)8. Android Update track record – I found that Samsung has one of the slowest update speeds, 6-10 months after official release (if you're lucky!). Which probably means no Android 10 until March 2020 :( May be things change in the OneUI era?First impressions, a full 5/5.I'll update with Long-term findings.--- 7th October, 2019. 1-week update ---One UI experience.So I've begun to appreciate OneUI in its entirety. The stutters have reduced, I guess when the phone was new there was a lot happening in the background. Besides, some of the intrusive stuff was still running which I've since force stopped and disabled.The features that I think are great additions over stock android...1. Open in pop-up view – True multitasking! A huge plus in my book.2. Always on display – A great feature to have on an AMOLED display and a 6,000mah battery.3. The screenshot toolbar – it's well designed and the added functionality is much appreciated.4. Gesture based quick app switcher – A neat and well implemented way of quickly moving through apps5. 9-band Equaliser – The presets and the fully customizable graphic equaliser have system wide effect over audio, a very underrated feature.6. Dark/Night mode – Android 10 will bring this at the system level. But it doesn't hurt to have it at some level already, even if its only for the system apps.What I think are half-baked or unrequired features...1. Aggressive auto brightness – The ambient light sensor almost always chooses a brighter than required output.2. Assistive touch – 2 pages to swipe through is a good idea but most of it is of absolutely no use! And there's no option to customise it either.3. Screenshot shortcuts – They've given 3 bad ways of doing it. And the award for the worst experience goes to... "Palm swipe"! Not only is it inconsistent but also senselessly cumbersome. 3-finger swipe on my Motorola worked flawlessly and was faster too. I tried the Assistive touch but that always-on-screen button soon became an eyesore. So I ended up with the Power button + Volume down key :(All my other 'first impressions' remain unchanged.A piece of advice for prospective buyers:If the negative reviews confuse you, please understand this – The negative reviews are by people who have either...1. Bought the device for the wrong reasons.2. Or have unrealistic expectations from a device that was available under 12k, at launch.3. Or have a genuine issue with a bad unit (a very small percentage).4. Or are paid trolls!Most of the negative reviews seem to fall in category 1. & 2.The USPs of this device are...1. A Very Very good display – It's accurate, most cheap AMOLED sporting devices are not. Which is why you get unnatural skin tones and unrealistic greens/reds with some other mid-range phones (Mi A3, Realme XT, Vivo z1x etc.)2. One UI – A FAR cleaner alternative to Chinese skins/ROMs3. Excellent battery life – 11/12hrs of SoT!4. Fast app opening speeds and RAM management5. Reliability!I ordered a case but it hasn't been delivered yet.Despite that there's not one scratch on the display or the back!You will be disappointed if you are buying this device particularly for...1. Build quality2. or Camera performance3. or Charging speed4. or Superfast updates5. or for making NFC payments (via Google pay or Samsung pay). Though not many outlets accept this in India, at least not in Tier 2 cities, as of 2019.Also remember that all other alternatives will come with their own set of drawbacks too.Can't have it all, not in 2019 at least.Rating unchanged, fully satisfied "for the price paid!".
This is not orginal phone this is made in india and not upto the mark as samsung . camera is not good quality and not mark upto 48MP  and battery is not good.
Good Product and amazing fast delivery by Amazon within 2 hour only.
Received M30s today and really  a great buy . Picture quality is too good . Can update more a week later on the perfomance. Dolby Atmos really rocks . Body build is better than usual SAMSUNG mobile. Perfomance is fine in my 6GB ram variant . Battery backup seems fine , hardly 5% is utilized for normal usage with 24×7 location,4G/ wifi and limited calls .The battery finally stood for 4 day for my limited use specified above. Overall perfomance is good and acceptable..
Value for money for this Smartphone & Thank you AMAZON.
One of the best Display Ever. One of the best Battery Ever. One of the Supperb Camera is Ever. Processor is Mindblowing.sAMOLED is Worth it. Exynose 9611 is Worth it. 6000mAh battery is worth it. 48MP Camera  is Worth it.ONE OF THE BEST BUDGET SAMSUNG MOBILE EVER..
Front Camera should be little better remaining all features are EXCELLENT!!!More than my expectations!!!.

SD card sometimes  un mounting  automatically.. we have to restart the phone to bring contents  in sd card.
Probably  the only con about this smartphone is its camera quality, specifically  that of the front camera. The selfies are strictly average, although you can make them work with some basic editing on Snapseed or Lightroom, but they lack detail. The images are soft. Also, there's no support for GCam out of the box, so that makes it worse. But you definitely can make them work, they aren't that bad.But other than that, this is a really great deal. I've heard people complaining  about creaking noises in the back panel, but personally, I haven't noticed any such thing. I even tried pressing the back panel hard to just see, but it seemed  pretty  solid to me. Apart from that, the battery is obviously  outstanding and so is the display. The UI is smooth and snappy as well, no lag noticed. However, I am not a gamer, so I don't know how would that turn out.Overall, I think if you can settle in the camera area a bit, it's a great deal, considering you also get Samsung's  excellent  after sales experience and support..
Well, this is another classic example like how our much hyped cinemas/movie do (Flop). I really thought Samsung is doing something to get back in the mid segment market with a quality product, but doesn't look like it. The only positive in this mobile is the battery, but it's too early to comment on it. Camera is not upto the mark, no gorila glass protection and more importantly this has sim detection issue especially Vodafone and idea. Bought this mobile but unable to use it. I would recommend Redmi phones over Samsung..
Camera quality is very bad. Blur in all photos. When zooming any pic, it cracks. If compared to redmi 7 pro camera, redmi is much better.
Product is very poorCamera is the worstDisplay is poorHitting issueHitting like blastingSo carefully buy at youre own risk.
I do not received Samsung m30s phone with phone back cover, flip cover and screen gtad cover... Please deliver my phone cover and screen cover....
Poor camera and performance and I'm unable to return the product. Battery heating issue.
Product is found damaged. Phone not getting Boot / Start.Need replacement.
nice battery and camera.
Received today best buy at given price..
I received my Samsung m30s , this phone is looking nice , camera quality is good , but amazon packing is poor.
Very good product at an affordable price , for Students it is a MUST, if you don't use your phone heavily consider going for Samsung Galaxy M10s It's almost the same features lesser price, but those who wants to push the limits just go for this phone 200% worth the price.Use tempered glass and back cover for protection, as the phone doesn't come with Gorilla glass 5 protection and sAMOLED screens are very delicate and costly.Very much satisfied, thank you amazon.Thanks for reading ; ).
It's a scame I am facing problem since day 1 I am facing battery problem and when I tried to contact Amazon and tried to replace product they said that will tell technicians to check your phone and then my phone's replace date is 10th Oct and I am complaining everyday and still they are not replying me and telling me that we will solve it not date is gone and I am trying to call them they are not even picking up the call ....... I will not buy anything form Amazon I hate this ... Amazon sucks....
mine is opal black and it look amazing ,user interface is better than all other phones.rear camera is good (all you need is good light and steady hand) in low light i would recommend of using flash (it takes more detail),front camera average in low lighting and good in natural light.you can play pubg on HD ultra smoothly, and hdr with constant 30+fps.the more interesting function is AR emojies (must try),& pubg works excellent after update.Massive Battery is hard to drain completely..
Mst phone hain.
Extremely bad network strength..Camera quality is not so good as it claims 48MP.  Also, mobile is heating up after few minutes of call. Disappointed from Samsung..
Delivered within two daysLooking awesomeBattery is really monstrousCamera is awesome and picture quality is also goodSound is goodDisplay is amazing..
no ear phonetouch not properslow speednot good quality.
This is good mobile battery 2 day working and camera is good wide angled so much good.
Display battery ok but  camera not goodDisine super light weight.
Product was good.Value for money but one thing I don't like is Samsung have not provided 15/18W charger in the box.Battery performance was superbYou can easily differ the pictures taken using wide angle camera.
Review of Samsung M30s (4GB variant ):I am pretty much sure that many people might have already purchased this device during Amazon festive season like me, later thought of writing review or rating or Checking what others purchaser thinks about this device, or if you are a person who is looking to purchase this device after Amazon festival season or after seeing this review then you have done a good job (even though you might have lost some perks, if any), So, that I can let you know certain things which people obviously miss out in seeing YouTube review videos.I hope you have time to read my review, So let me confirm to the scope of this review; I am not going speak about camera, display and other common stuffs, as many YouTubers have done good job in those areas and you can check out any video in the YouTube either English or Hindi or regional language of yours, they seems to be good. I personally gone through most of them they are all seems to speak in same aspect,  so, if you consider my suggestion you can check any one of them to know basic info, out of those videos; I thought most informative was Geekranjit and C4tech unboxing video.Let’s start out Pros and Cons which you may feel informative, I am writing this after using this device exhaustively for 2 days;Pros;1. I was afraid to buy Samsung device for the reason that, it comes with bloatware (Think as Useless apps). Thanks to Samsung One UI which has less apps and you can uninstall most of the apps including some of google apps which you don’t use. But be care full while setting up device; ensure you uncheck all unnecessary permission to avoid ads and bloatware. But funny thing is you can’t uninstall Netflix and Facebook, though you can disable them. (Approx. you will be having 12 to 15apps which you can’t disable or uninstall)2. Out of 4 GB ram you get 1.7 GB ram free and out of 64GB rom you get ~53GB (approx.) free out of box.3. Samsung one UI is good in ram management (that helps apps running in background and ease access all time you need)4. If you enable developer option you can see much customization, like;• Reducing animation (Helps in speeding up device)• Auto Night mode( which seems to be not working right now but after future updates bug will be fixed)• Limiting the background process• Under battery management option you can even set sleeping mode for desired apps.(For instance; I don’t want to see ads from true caller, I use it only to search unknown numbers therefore I put this app under sleep mode so it automatically force stop the app once I am done with my job so that It can’t send me notification)5. Battery management seems to be good and there is emergency mode to save your battery from draining.6. With respect to chipset it comes equipped with Exynos 9611 utilizes 10nm processor (Think like lesser nm means better speed and good performance, for instance Oneplus 7 pro utilizes 7nm so it is superfast). I personally compared this chip-set with snapdragon 712 (Used in Realme XT, Realme 5pro, other competitive devices) as per official website spec of these both seems to be same there is no exceptional differences, however as per some website they claim exynos 9611 is better than snapdragon 712 and other claims vice versa(Opposite). I do checked gaming review of both chip-set, both seems to be performing at par, worth to note again that Samsung one UI is boosting a lot this chipset for best performance. However, heating and lag was observed with the same chipset used in Samsung A50s while playing PUBG in high graphics. However, many gamer while playing PUBG on this device has suggested it’s good. (Check out gaming review of Gizmoddict for Samsung A50s {since same chipset} in YouTube for more information)Cons:1. Phone warms up little bit while doing multitasking you will be able feel near rare camera. (depends on app you use)2. Durability seems to be very bad you need to be much careful with this device, I am not going take any chance in it but still you can check out Gupta information system video with respect to durability test of Samsung m30s in YouTube.3. For some strange reason my songs which are in ogg format are not recognized as songs by music player in this device so I converted my entire song list to mp3 using some third party app.4. Auto brightness seems to be not adjusting automatically, I don’t know whether it is a bug or due to screen guard and I think in case of bug future updates may fix this bugs.5. In Samsung official page under support tab, I noticed this model will receive quarterly security updates, which is worth noting.6. Before making purchase of this device I noticed in some newspaper (I think Indian express) that  this device will receive Android Q update and Samsung is planning to give much support for this new M series device ( Don’t laugh because I noted in con section, since it just reported not guaranteed)(If you have any doubts about this device or need specific info you can comment or ask in Q&A section I would love to help you out, if I know).
Phone is heating too much within 10 to 15minutes of normal using. Camera quality is very poor. Shutter speed  also slow..
Awesome Battery life.
Never expected this kinda inferior product from the Big brand like Samsung.Here are pros and consPros:-1. Screen (at 11.6K price)2. Battery (6K mAh though will perform like 4K mAh due to software issue I guess coz hardware has 6K capacity) Cons :-1. Camera Sucks2. Performance Choppy even in normal uses not talking about gaming3. GPU Sucks very slow performance in the gaming4. Heating issues while playing gamesWouldn't recommend any one to buy this phone.
Excellent.
Camera quality Disappointed front camera,  not clear images 16 mp like 8 mp, phone  heavy waite hand on , not purchase camera lovers.
Body material is very worst.
Not impressed with the camera. I don't find the "48 mp" camera to be any good..
good.
Build quality is patheticCell reception is badBattery drains like hellTotally regrettable purchace.
I bought the Samsung M30s on 28th Sept. But I am highly disappointed with this phone due to the following reasons:1. Camera quality is pathetic ( i don't think it's 48 MP)2. The phone didn't read my sim...(i used multiple Sims).
Worst..heating problem.

Amazon selling LIE ...mobile heated during call and charging the phone..camera quality is very bad..please don't buy this mobile.
Everyone knows pros like battery, screen etc etc but there are many cons to1. Ram available is around 1.5 GB which becomes 800mb without much use2. Wifi speed is less, I have 50mbps plan and my m30s showing 30mbps whereas  my moto z play showing 48mbps3. Record time for super slow motion video is 2-3 sec only4. Camera quality is ok ok only5. Phones support max 15watt charge only.
Its my First Purchase of Samsung Galaxy Smartphone, its M30s. Previously used other brands like Motorola, Nokia, Xiaomi, Vivo.As it was Global Brand, I trusted and Expected more from the Specs advertised or mentioned, But from 1st day of delivery i found it was Defective. Yes Defective Product delivered by Amazon India.Coming to Device Review :- Only Display sAmoled with Full HD+ was good, and some how The one ui was good.Battery backup was like 4000 mah only, processor heats a lot up-to 46 degree. And consumes more power, power hungry processor, so battery lasts less time.Product was Feel like cheap because poor build quality, makes back panel and sides crackling sound.Even One ui having ads, yes but it can be stopped when initial setup of device to not to receive any marketing information unlike Xiaomi.Cameras also Above Average, front camera is below Average only.Overall Not expected from Samsung Brand.For the Display Only I am giving 2 stars, rest was a crap, because of Overheating of Device when Using Normally without Gaming, and Battery drains a lot in idle also..
5 stars for delivery as I got it within 24 hours of placing order. Working awesome and smooth! I will update this review after 15 days of usage..
Phone is reasonably good at the price 12699rs. display quality is very good. Black color is decent with little green mixed in the corner. Phone could have been little handy in size apart from that back side panel is little cheaper in terms of touch nd feel. But can't blame it bcz of its price point..
Camera was not at all worthy of even 1000 rsElse everything is unbelievable extraordinaryCamera disappointed me.
very dispointed with camera..its not like 48 mp..front camera  is also very poor as compared my Y1 front camera (16mp).. prefered it only because of its 48 mp camera and brand name SAMSUNG..but huge disppointment...
First of all I would like to mention the battery life of SAMSUNG GALAXY M30s , it's superb no need of power bank you can use it for one and half day when fully charged . And the SUPER AMOLED display is awesome. The most important thing is the CAMERA quality 48 MP is also superb as it's giving an equal performance when compared to DSLR cameras . Everything in M30s are superb. Mobile is very comfortable while holding, the curves are really nice that's helping to feel comfortable. Over all it's a very nice mobile. And thanks amazon for "GREAT INDIAN SALE".SUPERB MOBILE..

The 7A is nothing extraordinary to look at but neither is it ugly.You'll find all the basics like a practical design, curved back, front + rear cameras and 3.5mm audio jack.Good qualities:Smooth performance, triple card slot, fast face unlock, wireless FM (no headset needed) + FM recording, large battery, great camera (esp. for the segment), matte finish polycarbonate back panel, splash resistant P2i coating.Bad qualities:No fingerprint unlock, skips the IR emitter port, supports 10W charging but only 5W charger included.Value of money 8Performance 6.
Mobile is not  doing good work.
This is VOLTE.
It is nice product.
Handset will be powerfully.
OK for this amount.
It's colour and the price really worth..
Some times double tap screen light on not working... There is no option to crop select on while taking screen shot.... There is no VR mode... Remaining all good.
Mobile is exceptional. But amazon cheated people in the name of great Indian shopping festival..
People reviewing the product should first keep in mind the amount of money they paid for it, and in that league this phone will get topmost position with regard to specs and warranty. We are getting enough power in the bank to last 2 days with normal to heavy usage. We are getting enough pixels in the photo to make it what's app dp or showoff on fb. We are getting enough app management customization over and above latest android. And don't tell me that you don't know about 2 years warranty period with same amount. All in all you will get all required features a budget phone should have and all the satisfaction that a premium phone brings..
Accessories to buy back cover, temporary glass ,etc is not available.
This phone is best in its price range..4000 mah battery is just litFast delivery...Got delievered in less than 24 hours.
As per product description there are 12 MP camera, but actual camera not good. Poor Camera clarity. Low performance. Over all waste of money..i want to return but there are no option..
Head phone is mentioned in pack ad. But disappeared in product....
I purchased this mobile @ 4500/- with card offer.  Here are the pros and cons ÷Pros* Fast processor* Latest  Pie OS* 4000 Mah battery* Look is great* Rear Camera is perfect* Dual Volte.Cons* Very heavy* Front camera is average* screen is not Full HDConclusion ÷ This is the best segment under  5k budget. Good for daily use..
When u are not using the phone for 30-40 minutes  the double tap to wake up phone does not work properly & same problem with face unlock feature. Plz help.
Good items..........goods product at this price value of money....
Servec not good.
Replace options should there with same the brand..
Redmi 7A is a good looking phone with good battery backup. Screen resolution could have been better but for a phone costing 5k, I guess cannot expect better.
Super.
You say it is covered under 2 years Warranty but inside the Box I found only 1 year warranty card. Please clarify is it cheating or something else?.
Return should be allowed if someone is not finding it fit for use.
I like this.
I purchased Redmi 7a (2gb/32gb) for my father as his earlier phone had been troubling; I was expecting to start using the phone immediately. what i recd was a phone with older version of the software. I was not able to configure the phone as it was asking to update the softwares. I have put the phone on wifi for the entire night and still, after 15 hours it is just 57% updated. Utterly disappointing. When we purchase a new phone, we expect the software versions to be updated to the latest one. This is ridiculous..
Heating issue.
It's very pathatick, after two days it's getting heat when it will getting charging also CSA not helpful. You can't return also when it will be delivered.Don't purchased.
If you are a normal user and do not care about playing heavy games then this is a pocket friendly phone. Looks very nice. Not big or small and perfectly fits into your hand. Touch is buttery smooth and responsive. Haven't noticed any lags or heating issue in my limited testing. Battery backup is excellent I would say. It will last easily for two days for normal usage. It has dedicated slot for micro sd card, not a hybrid model. So don't need to worry on that front. Supports dual VOLTE. While there is no finger print scanner it is not a big negative as it is a budget phone. UI is bit clumsy, but I guess that is not an isolated problem with this model, but all redmi phones. Xiomi also announced MIUI 11 update by December. Hopefully that will improve user experience. Overall at this budget you won't regret. Try to buy during a sale with bank discounts. Overall thumps up for this..
Phone is not working properly.
Those who have some high expectations, pls excuse.. Coz me too gone through the same..I can list out the pros and cons of it in my perspective/experiencePros:1.Brand Value2.Build quality & design is better even if it's plastic3. Tune synced hardware and software4. Battery life5. Not so charming screen like Realms or similar but ok6. So apt for senior parents, uncles and aunts and wives having minimal usage.Cons:1. Dont expect 10+k priced Redmi mobiles' photo quality. It's just below average.2. No fingerprint sensor.(it's a budget phone).3. App lock won't work with Redmi factory apps.4. (A common issue on Redmis)Nasty adult type video suggestions when camera or other videos are being playedback. Can't even hand it over to kids or parents while we want to show something of ours.4Light weight. We don't get a feeling of holding a mobile phone..
amazing product seriously with in this price amzing.
Garib ka iphone.... Looking for small size mobile... Nice & Cute mobile... In hand feeling is very good... Specs & user experience is good in this price... Don't expect too much.... Camera is good in daylight... Struggles in low light...But if you know how to use pro mode then... Just enjoy capturing... Attached pro mode photo... Captured at night....
warranty card & user manual not in the box. how to collect this.
Not a worth of RS.5499/-.
Wifi not working on this mobile ..
Bought this for my father , really great phone at this price.Good battery backup with 4000MHz.Camera performance is decent , you can not expect more from this budget segment device.Mobile is bit bulky and thin compared to other devices if you are okay with it you can go ahead.Wireless FM and 2 years warranty is plus point for this mobile.Note : Not made for gaming , you can play low graphics games.Best device for elder peoples who just want decent smartphone with good battery backup.Package includes :Mobile device , manual and warranty infoNo handsfree , No screen guard or Case/Cover.
Good deal, bought it for my mother who has only normal use like call and WhatsApp. Good screen,good camera, very swift ,wireless radio,dual sim with dedicated memory slots. Good microphones.  Very good 4000mah battery.Worthy mobile for nominal use. Not sure about game lovers will love it. I exchanged my Samsung j2 prime 2016 and exchange price was too attractive. For me it's almost a free mobile.Thanks Amazon for timely and safe delivery..
Brought 2Gb + 16 Gb for Rs. 4500 during the sale. Out of the box 8 Gb is free.Not happy with amazon packing.Instead of card board packing they packed using cover.Battery is good.Need to camera in day light conditionsIn low conditions camera is not good.Supports 10 W battery but 5 W battery battery only included in box.No finger print sensor. Face unlock works fine but slow.Need to check after long term use regarding battery heat issues. As of now no issues with battery..
Got this mobile @4999 Rupees and I am very much happy with the product because the battery is long-lasting and in this range the mobile is a good deal for everyone and it comes with two year warranty. The camera quality is good for the price the customer is paying and the processor speed as good as well. The mobile comes with updates which keeps  every function improving,Definitely 7a model is good android phone in this price range compare to its peer companies..
Charger was not working from the starting. i was found a waste charger from that phone, and when i call the customer care they were checking all the time online and remote to find the problem but there was not any problem with the phone, because the chargers of the other mobile was working absolutely with this mobile and its charger was not working with any phone. The customer care was looking that my as a suspected eyes.that's why i have purchased a new charger for that mobile and not call again the customer care..
I like to change to Redmi 7 for 2 GB 32GB RAM.So like to return Redmi7a.
This phone is really worth for money.I bought this phone for my dad.Key Features1. 4000 mAh.2. FM with out wire3. 12MP Sony camera4. 2 SIM + 1 memory card slot (very useful if you want to increase memory)5. Face Unlock6. Size of 5.45 (so it is handy for elderly people also who are not comfortable for big phone)7. 2 GB Ram + 16 GB storage ( of Which system storage is 6.4 GB).
This is an amazing deal for a secondary device. Specially I bought it for my Mother. And she can't be any happier. She has very little use of any performance prone applications. Yes. This phone is not for performance hungry apps. Games like PUBG cannot be enjoyed. As the internal space is very less, and ram is just 2 GB. But tasks like daily browsing, social media and YouTube run like butter on a hot pan. Camera is not what you would expect from this. Just a decent amount of pixels. And trust me the pictures I shot on this have come out great. Yes they are edited on Lightroom. Battery is amazing and will last you long. Screen somewhat is its draw back. In broad daylight, you will have to increase the brightness to maximum. But got it on sale for 4499/- makes it a steal deal. Even if you want to buy a first smartphone it's amazing. Also it's direct comparison is from Redmi Go. Which lands somewhere under 5k and a few bucks can be added to buy this device. Trust me you would not regret buying this. Realme C2 is also a good option if you hate the adverts on the MIUI. But for me C2 feels too big and small phones are really a thing. Go for it..
As per price ram and storage is good, phone look nice, sound is avarage, camera quality not satisfaid, VERY BED mobile battery 20% charging take One HOUR Given company charger its problem all  my friend and family member used this  mobile phone  experiance.Requiest to company please provide the fast mobile charging Charger to next coustmer like 5v-2A and aboveIf possible replace my mobile  charge to do it  I am waiting for your positive response. Value for money average..
Redmi 7A is the best budget phone available in the market as of now (October 2019) for basic purposes. The price is reasonable and easily affordable for normal usage. Every feature in this phone are worth for the price, except the low loudness of the volume system for listening to music or watching videos. Speakers could have been much more better than they are.Overall I give 4 stars out of 5.
its value for money. nice display. AI face recognition. dual sim 4g VOLTE. Seperate Memory card slot. Decent look. I liked blue color. handy mobile. no heating issue. longer battery  backup. 2GB RAM 16GB ROM enough for regular use. FM redio without connecting head phone that is a nice feature. Android 9 OS. sound is good. Head phone not provided in the pack. charger cable is too short.I got it with excellent offer. Happy with this mobile..
Excellent Specifications in this Price Range .And 4000mah high capacity battery . Camera Quality is Good also . I gift this fone to my mom . She is very happy ... THANK YOU xiaomi and Thank You Amazon for Great Deal.
With 2 weeks the touchpad not functioning, which was replaced at mi gallery. actually they should replace with new piece.Poor quality dont buy faulty touchpad, Mi/Amazon should replace. Mi service centre didn't advise to contact Amazon for replacement..
Very Slow Charging, when i received it was about 73% battery. It was connected to charging at 73% and after 90% it starts to slowdown and at 96%it stucked for 20minutes then every 1% charged in each 5minutes, totally disgusting. 2hrs for 25%charging. Better to buy any other brand. I will wait for 2 days to check any further defects to report so pls contact me back for an urgent resolution.
Thank you amazon these is a good phone arrived to us......amazing phone with lot of new technologies....lookin good display in this price .camera quality good. Very nice, wonderful slim desugn. Battery life is good but upgrade the battery and charging speed. Value for money excellent battery, camera , display, ram and storage....nyc product from redmi.
I bought this phone for my mother,He is very happy..!.
Not at all satisfied with the device. Screen doesn't wake up imidiatlly on call. Takes time to wake up after a half of the ring. Power button have to press 3 to 4 times to wqke up the screen, If it is used after few mins..
I have purchased this on great indian festival,mobile performance is very good ,worth buy for its original price, no fingerprint sensor but face detection unlock is there.compared other mobiles like realme and Samsung this is better option for 80's people.
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE TO SOMEONE IT'S THE BEST PRODUCT TO LIFT IT IN THE AMAZON DIWALI SALE I GOT IT FOR RS 3500 AND THE FINGERPRINT READER, CAMERA QUALITY AND BATTERY LIFE OF THE PHONE A SUPERBAll over the price was nice to gift it to someone.
Worst camera while using third party applications(whatsapp, camscanner) with flash, Image gets overexposed. One who uses whatsapp camera and camscanner to scan documents, please buy any other model.If anyone facing the same issue please tell me..
After clicking the photo it takes time to capture,losing the moment.Photo quality is ok (good),can be used for notes Copy clear letters.Pro mode and hdr mode is slow.Selfie camera is ok .Battery is great, easily we can get 1 and half day battery life with normal use.Features are great.300 mb games run smoothly (bus stimulator).Built quality and look is wonderful.It is best phone in the segment, worth a buy..
The phone looks as described on the website. It looks good, but I cannot say about the features which you can avail with internet facility because I am in J & K and we do not have mobile internet here. The delivery of the product was really fast..
The system updater is also not functioning, besides the phone hanging from day one. Not satisfied at all. Called up Amazon customer service they refuse to speak in English. Also, they did not bother to help at all. I cannot even update the software, since there is an error..
This product with its price range is just like a magical product along with its 2 years warranty. I have ordered two. Don't get any negative thing in it. But best for elders who don't use too many apps not suitable for teenager's..
I am using it now, i don't know how this mobile will react in future but currently this phone's performance is 100%Speakers produce slightly low sound n everything is fineIf you want to buy a phone under 6000 then buy this phone because it is manufactured from Xiaomi 'the best smartphone brand and also functions are very best..
Heating problem, slow charging,  and this product doesn't have return policy, be careful before buying,  because I am using this phone forcefully. 0 rating for amazon service..
It’s a phone with good build quality, excellent battery life and also comes with two-year warranty. A good phone For first-time smartphone buyersCamera performance is below average, but considering its price tag I believe there is nothing to worry about it :).
Very good phone , please provide me the 2year warranty receipt for this.
Processing very slow and interface is also not up to the mark.You can have better phone on adding 2 -3K in your budget.I purchased in Dussehra festival offer did not receive rs 500 cash back yet.Already registered a complaint..
Battery life is best for this smartphone as it comes with less specifications but huge battery, got in 3300 in exchange as well as Diwali offer, great peice at great price.
Proximity sensor is not working properly, the screen turns black during calls and you won't be able to use any key.I am facing this problem after the return period is over , running for service centers .Xiaomi service center executives don't have any manners , they don't care about customers at all..
Mi mindbloing phone. All friends purchase minimum this phone . Thanks.
Pros:1. Long battery life2. Latest MIUI updates available.Cons:1. 2GB RAM2. No finger print scanner.3. Plastic body..
A beast in terms of police got it int just 4500.Pros- 5.45 inch screen with good colors,  decent battery life,  Sony I'm 486 senior is a monster at this price, miui 10 and android 9 makes everything smooth,  supports 4g volteCons- Ai mode Not at all good  2gb ram not enough with miuiOverall a good phone and great value for money.
I got this phone in just 2100 with the exchange of Redmi 5A.Got 2-year warranty + Acko screen warranty, what else one can get by exchanging his 18 months old phone and getting a new better latest phone. Awesome. :).
Awesome Mobile, go for it. You won't regret.Super display, super battery. One thing is it only has 8GB of internal storage out of 16GB.Overall it's best Mobile with the price. Feels really good. No lag, no heating. Awesome phone but Xiaomi.
I love this productA good budget phone just front camera disappointed me...Overall good product I just love it......
BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD.IT WILL LAST FOR ONE DAY WITH  SINGLE CHARGING.UNDER THIS PRICE IT IS A GOOD DEVICE.CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT SO GOOD..
This Redmi 7A mobile is the best and work quickly.it has given octa core processor with Android 9.0 pie latest version and face lock will also be provided by Redmi.camera quality is good but not excellent.and this battery life is excellent.redmi has not provided in this phone fingerprint reader.but phone is the best.
Second day i recd my product. After 1 week of usage product is awesome for aged person who are not using mob for gaming. Simply awesome product at this pricing.....
Well best. Though nothing can becl best...better is appropriate. What I liked was it's performance of everything but though some missings are like it does not have fingerprint scanner which is now available in every phone. Front camera is not as upto mark. Yet everything is fine...reader would find satisfaction!!!.
It was the first gift from me to my Papa. He was so happy n emotional when he saw this gift. So, though cost was less it has a huge emotional value now...Battery is superb with nice back n front camera too. A big display in just 4999/-.Loved this product..
No tax invoice is provided with the product so request you please provide the retail invoice for future use.Except the top of box no two year warranty mentioned anywhere with the product. Warranty card provided with product is a generalize card mentioned only one year warranty please clear it?.

Good with some doubts....
The 7A is nothing extraordinary to look at but neither is it ugly.You'll find all the basics like a practical design, curved back, front + rear cameras and 3.5mm audio jack.Good qualities:Smooth performance, triple card slot, fast face unlock, wireless FM (no headset needed) + FM recording, large battery, great camera (esp. for the segment), matte finish polycarbonate back panel, splash resistant P2i coating.Bad qualities:No fingerprint unlock, skips the IR emitter port, supports 10W charging but only 5W charger included.Value of money 8Performance 6.
Mobile is not  doing good work.
This is VOLTE.
It is nice product.
Handset will be powerfully.
OK for this amount.
It's colour and the price really worth..
Some times double tap screen light on not working... There is no option to crop select on while taking screen shot.... There is no VR mode... Remaining all good.

BEST PHONE UNDER 10K.OR UNDER 15K....CAMERA IS AWESOME.FEEL LIKE U USE A 20K PHONE.THE PHONE LOOKS SO COOL.
Phone hanged many times .I return it for replacement but not get back yet.Amazon shipping and replacement service is too bad. I uploaded a video.....
best mobile under 10000.
Pros- batteryCameraPriceLookCons- delicate. So has to be handled carefully.It took 10 days for the product to reach..
Loving the phone....Purchased with bank discount,6gb 128gb blue variant...i must say,it looks super awesome....having gorilla glass protection in front and back,it makes it even better....i would like to inform one thing that there is no 60fps video recording even after being mentioned on official website,and also there is no fingerprint gesture feature...it may come with miui 11 which is going to come within next 10 days as it is in phase 2 devices....Camera is really cool,getting some decent clicks,just install google camera and the quality is much much betterBattery backup is quite good as well,just turn off dual 4g,dont use volte if not necessary,turn of auto start for apps which u feel are not required,keep miui battery saver turned on for better backup,keep gps off when not needed,just do small adjustments and battery will surely last longerPerformance is also great considering the chipset you are getting,infact u also get 4g+ which is not even there on redmi note 7 pro and would never come also....so internet speed,call quality,signal strength...everything is impressiveI must say,in this price range,this phone totally deserves praises from all....i hope i tried to cover all points and helped people to look for this phone as a good option for them...All the best....
Redmi note 8 is the best Smartphone under 10k of the year 2019.
Awesome mobile under 10K..
Nice product ...India's No One. Brand.
This product is very good and very good quality thank you Amazon thank you so muchI am use this device 6 day very smuthly and very fast and fast charge charging time 1 hour 45.
To all consumers who are looking for a decent midrange smartphone today, this Redmi Note 8 is a solid pick.Ads? You can disable it on Settings, though disabling it one by one but worth it after doing it.Chipset? It's above average since it can play graphic demand games very well. Day to day work? So dang good. Transition between apps is no slouch.Compared to same level smartphones the display looks crispy, and speakers are powerful. At last, its highly customisable system brings a great experience for hard users.Cameras? Stock app is straight garbage (except the macro mode). Just install google Camera and you're good to go. Details will be flagship like.The battery it's good as well and gaming it's a "just good" experience, not bad at all (smooth on high preferences, not ultra)Price? Bang of the buck for this segment!Highly recommended for people who doesn't want confusion on buying this price range....
I purchased it from redmi store. Its performance is awesome.Super clarity display, good battery backup, super loud speaker with thunder voice.... Etc.... U can buy this without thinking more.
King of budget phones, but 3 star because of very annoying add's. What the hell xiaomi thinking. They didn't given it for free i have paid for the device!Amazon delivery 5/5 (on time)Camera 4/5 wide angle is very goodDisplay 5/5Network 4/5Charging. 3.5/5 its taking aprox 2.02 min to  3 min if mobile data is ONGorilla glass5  3/5 (already got a scratch even after taking careFinger print  4/5 (not fast as other phone's)Face unlock 3/5  ( realme u1 is double faster)IR blaster works great.
It took around 9 days to get the product delivered. It's a great phone. Battery backup is awesome. Fast charger is provided in the box. Front Camera isn't that great, but still, it's very good. Rear camera takes good pictures. Fingerprint is also very fast, but little bit slow as compared to my Realme 3 pro. Still fingerprint is fast enough. Also, the glass back is awesome. Overall a good phone. Got it for 8,999/-Also got Rs 100 Amazon cashback. It's a killer deal even in 9,999/-. Just go for it..
Purple is too good..
If u are a WiFi user ....then pls don't buy this phone....I have received replacement with same problem.So finally I returned the phone ( as both phone have same WiFi issues)May everyone didn't notice the WiFi connectivity time .....I stay full time in WiFi ,so pls check how longer it stay connected to WiFi ..In my case after 2 to 3 hr ...WiFi shows unavailable until I restart phone..

Best Smartphone In This Price..
Very good product and camera quality is extremely good.
Network connectivity is too low and battery backup is not good ,camera quality is not that what they show in add, very dull with least details camera picture.
i purchased redmi note 8 in first sale on 21st october i am very happy with the performance and build quality is really great  redmi gave 18w fast charger in box i am very happy the price. (key specs) processor snapdragon 665,4000 mah baterry with18w fast charging,quad cameras (8+48+2+2),13mp selfie cmaera,6.39 inch fhd display,fingerprint sensor face unlock i am giving some picture sample taken by redmi note8 if u want a good phone at price of 10k then take redmi note 8.  please like my review.
Camera not good. Bad performance . Battery  charging very slow . I don't like this product..
Every thing looks good except camera.#After zooming photo black spots found on face. You can see it on sample pic.#Tuch is little bit slow..
If you are planning to buy Redmi Note 8, check my experience as followsPro's :1. Camera: 48 MP Quad camera gives well exposed output. Note 8's camera is one of the Best in under 10k price segment.- It also have ultra-wide, macro depth sensor.- Front camera is also great.- Capable to shoot 4k 30 fps, slow motion 120 fps.2. Snapdragon 665: which is handles daily to day multitasking pretty well.3. 4000 mAH Battery: easily lasts for a day,18 watt charger included inside box which helps to charge mobile fully in 2 hours.4. Notification LED.5. IR Blaster.6. Dedicated SD card slot.7. Headphone jack.8. Gorrila glass 5 on front and back.Con's:- When playing PUBG with high settings, sometime it lags with frame drops.Verdict:If you are looking for phone for daily use with amazing camera quality, then Note 8 is right choice for you.But if looking for gaming then don't buy this one..
The phone has major touch glitches. After trying at least 3-4 times, got this phone recently. All the excitement of receiving a new phone vanished when the touch started acting up. The phone shudders and starts operating on its own without even touching it. The camera features are quite good but the phone should be made stable first. Disappointed. Don't buy in flash sale. Their testing process is still going on..
Ok Google feature is not supporteing.Showing language ia not supported in access with voice match setting for all languages....So u can't use ok google..
Awesome Camera at this price range.Stunning OutlookPowerful performance4000 mah battery with fast charging support(18watt charger in the box)Triple slot.
cool mobile.. its not completely purple but mixed with blue also.. the camera ll touch the surface wen used without a proper pouch.. but i like it ,front camera z not tat good. over all worth the price.. very good package for 10 k...
Lot of issues with the phone software. Loads of unwanted stuff on the phone. Screen is very bright in the night and even the lowest setting does not work well. Google Assistant does not work. Voice activation for Assistant does not work. Xiaomi does not have answer for it. No point getting a phone and struggling with it. Better phones available..
I purchased this product during the first flash sale. I got a completely diffractive phone. When I switch on the phone I found that touch screen is not working. So I fail to move to the next pages for activating phone functions. I don't expect this from Redmi and Amazon..
Best phone under 10k price range.
This is my 3rd phone.....1st 2 ones are  moonlight white......& this one is cosmic purple...which sort of blue on the top & it comes downnu can see purple.The phone looks feel really good.....& This colour looks stunning...camera seems good & it takes some good images.... overall satisfied.
side & Bottom border area keyboard keys are not working properly, like p, q, capslock, backspace, '?123', navigation keys like back, home etc. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't, it's very irritating when you have to correct spelling by deleting the misspelt word due to miss of the letter. At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed------------------------------------------REPLACED------------------------------------Got it replaced with another handset, though the keys I mentioned above seem to be responding fine now, other areas are giving similar problem, like the 'abc' key which is used to switch the keyboard from letters to number and symbols. Also, after dropping down the notification shade the setting gear icon is not responding properly.  Screen touch issues lies in many places over the screen. So the hit-miss pattern is still on but on some other areas. This is very irritating. The voice leak during call still lingering over some or other calls..
After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention:1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it.2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight.3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick.4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi.  I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone.To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi.Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range..
The most disappointing think is that the SIM slot is put already by the company upside down and slightly bend from the top I have to bend it also on the other side to make it straight and when I put the SIM there is no chance that will keep the SIM card but it show the SIM card range so it means it's not damage just slightly bend and I don't like the redmi branding on the front I am expecting the clean look.
Very Good Color and Fast Delivery Amazon.. Redmi Note 8 Like.
Nice quality, smooth finger frint , camera quality superb , everything is superb in this new lauch models 10 out of 10 marks.
This is good.
Nice camera .... Game play like SD855. Battery back up good ... Slight heating phone.  whileplaying games  but its ok .... Under 10K  this beast phone among other .... its my 3rd series of Redmi phone ... .. Thank you for making this amzijg phone ...Battery charging full in 1:45 hrs  ....
Only reason I bought it, it's supports dual app asAs of now Realme clone supports phonepe and many more so.....Before I buying it I guessed it could have battery have issue. Now I am facing the same. As Redmi 4000mah is not enough to run a fhd mobilesmoothly a day. This is same with Redmi note 7s.Now about the camera, sound, display , charging speed, all are good.My old Realme 1 has good battery life than this.I hope you got a little idea about Redmi note 8You can buy it . If you love Redmi .In one word I also love this mobile as it comes with a full loaded features and prices..
Lightly Disappointed with battery backup . And slower connection.Bad response from agent to replacement it's not good in marketing behaviour.
The camera is good, but you will have to install Google camera to get the best out of it. The stock cam is not that great.The build quality is good and so is the designThe display could have been better, not that great. The display on my asus zenfone maxpro m2 is better, according to meBiggest drawback is the flash sale - It's a hit or a miss. However, I got it on day 1..
I was very happy that I bought it in first sale but my happiness ruined because Amazon delivered me a faulty product. Whenever I try to turn on my mobile from sleep it always take 5 to 8 seconds to just turn on the screen, no matter whether I am trying with fingerprint sensor/Double tap method or pressing right side button. I tried to replace the product but Amazon checked my phone with some terrible blancco app and said that there is no fault in my mobile. They didn't replaced it. pathetic. Don't purchase this mobile from here..
Best camera Phone desgin is awesome. Great Phone 6 gb 128 gb varient.
Redmi note 8 is best quality phone in budget.Rear camera is superb quality& processor is good. Battery is good..
My two years old Motorola G5 has better downloading speed  than Redmi note 8 when using same jio network in both the phone.Even after complaining 2 times no mobile expert came to my house & made fake report that phone is ok.Never buyRedmi phone again in life because they are installing cheap components in their mobiles..
This is probably the best all-rounder in sub rs 10000 (9999). I got is in 8999 with offerPros1. Very premium looking with glass design2. Display is bright enough3. A good processor ( though better one snapdragon 710 is available at same price with realme 3 pro)4. 48 mp ( really a 16mp) camera is superb5. Four camera setup gives flexibility to your photograph with wide angle and macro lens6. Night photos are also good7. 18 watt fast charg support and also inside the box availableCons.1. Glass design may get cracked when fall down from height.2. SD 710 is also available at same price range from realme3. Redmi may have used Samsung gm2 48mp sensor which is better compared to gm1.4. Though wide angle camera is good it is still an 8mp5. The Qualcomm quick charge is very slow when compared with VOOC6. It has been long days (4-5 years) redmi is using 4000mAh battery. Though it is big enough but battery capacity should be increased to 4500mAh same as its pro versionIf I find anything else I will update it..
Nice.
I m buying redmi note 8 by Amazon it's front camera is lower level.
Redmi note 8 is a complete all-rounder.This review is after 15 days of usage.The pros of this phone are as follows1) PriceI got it at an effective price of Rs.8500 during the sale days. Even then @Rs.10000 it is still a very good buy.2) Built QualityThe phone is extremely sturdy, which might be very helpful for rough and tough use. And the glass back gives a very premium feel but need to be extra careful for that.Also Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection is very helpful.3) BatteryThe battery easily lasts for more than a day with mediocre usage.4) Quick chargingThe co. a fast charger in the box, it takes around 1 hour 45 min to charge from 0 to 100.5) ProcessorIt works extremely well for day to day tasks (don't know about high CPU consumption games like Pubg and all)6) Sound qualityThe Audio speaker is loud for a normal environment.7) Dedicated SD card slot8) SizeThe phone is 6.3 inch, though bigger than palm sized phone, it is always an better option than the 6.5 inch phones which have become a trend in today's market.Cons1) CameraThe quality of camera is not like 48mp. Its not that great nor that bad. It's okay okay types.2) BloatwareThere are huge no. of pre installed apps and the ads are still very much a part of OS.3) Flash SaleI think the concept of flash sales should be dropped , due to this many people could not avail the discounts during the festive sales.4) Heating IssueThe phones heats up a bit while charging but it's completely normal considering the fast charging and other factors.5) BulkyThe phones seems bulky at times. Its somewhere round 200 gmsConclusion:The best buy at @10000 at this price range and the features.Could not ask for more..
There is some serious pblm with this phone no upi supported ...U cant use upi paymnt facility in this phone ..or other function rltd to upi ..And xiaomi claims its a fast chrging not fast charging its takes arround more thn 2 hrs ...Its 10 watt chrging compare side by side  with 10 watt it is same as 10 watt no 18 watt ,fakes 18 watt charging only to compete with real me ...One major con is upi and another one is no 18 watt fast charging ..battery ok ok. No great....
pooor performance in signals and camera quality is nice but oral phon is verry bad worst mobile i had ever seen.
Just mind-blowing in rs-9999 thank you redmi for build redmi note 8.
I am fully satisfied with this phone, battery is good, screen quality is good especially the black, it looks like amoled display.Gg5 glass on top is so solid that even geans can't scratch the glass, it is far superior than redmi note 7. It worth the upgrade. I got a 170k score on antutu which is very high on this price segment.The cameras are the main highlight of this phone, the 48mp takes amazing pictures and videos(4k) at night, pixel binning comes very handy at night situations.The macro camera is also good, don't bother the 2mp resolution, it takes amazing pictures.The ultra wide lens is very nice, it takes pictures at 120° angle.There is a glass covering on the fingerprint which makes it very easy to clean it.The depth sensor with the help of mi camera takes very eye catching portraits.The most amazong part is the phones comes with a 18watt charger in the box, it charges my phone from 20 to 95 percent in 1 hour.I prefer the moonlight white color of this phone, it looks so premium..
Not at all satisfactory, phone hangs a lotReceived new mobile with dent.
Best VFM among current phones if not looking for a gaming centric phone.Ratings:Build quality: 10/10Display: 6/10 (no colour accuracy and viewing angle from bottom gives dull display, not very legible outdoors as only 390 nits brightness. Only saving grace is the FHD resolution)Cameras: 8/10 (9/10 with gcam) , wide angle 8MP too less, very less details when zoomed in.Battery backup & Charging speed: 9/10 (unfortunately no new charging animation as shown in promotion material)UX/OS: 6/10 (not buttery smooth), 8/10 (after uninstalling bloatware, disabling ads and installing Nova launcher)Speaker: 8/10 (loud & clear enough but sounds a bit tinny/hollow-ish compared to my Moto g5 plus)Call quality & network reception: 8/10Overall considering price: 9/10Good packaging and quick two day delivery by Amazon (non Prime)Edit (5-Dec-2019): After MIUI 11.0 update the new battery charging animation is now available. Hooray! :D.
This is the best camera phone under 10K.Battery 9/10Camera 9/10Display 8/10Look 10/10.
Great mobile.
Nice mobile camera is good value of money.
Awesome phoneBut delivery was very bad , it take 11 days to arrive package on prepaid order.
Redmi.. Please explain what does means of  48 MP camera... Totally fake is just like ordinary camera...
The camera quality is way to worst during jio video calling and Instagram...were as me and my family has used many mi device those are best this is just horrible I feel like throwing this device on the manufacturer face...I can't return this device ..coz I used those things few days later after the return period got over ....I regret buying this device ...real me n oppo n Vivo were offering many good deal in the same price ..I way loyal to mi ...so without thinking twice I got this....but I regret buying this now.
Heating Problem,worst quality in Camera, battery drains too early , takes long time for full charging almost more than 2 hours. Worst phone. Worst quality. Heating problem.
Best in budget..
i love the product quality and its good one in redmi products. i got  the mobile with in 2 days delivery timecamera , ram , display quality  and battery power also well even compare to other productmobile design same like normal redmi mobiles only.
I just received the box , as soon as i opened it I noticed a big scratch on the corner. I don't know whom to blame. Some traces of glue are also visible.
Redmi note 8(4gb,64gb,Moonlight White)Pros & Cons:" Redmi launches it's new phone in the indian market from the price 9999.I'm using this phone for last 4days and this is my review.Redmi Note 8 's most attractive thing is its look,this phone comes with a glossy glass back with white and blue shade and side edges are made of plastic but it just looks like stainless steel and it run MiUi 10 based on android 9,gives you preety cool experience,but this custom ui have so many bloatware and ads.Second thing is its camera,note 8 comes with a 48mp quad camera array.first one is a 48mp camera with pro mode and ai mode.second one is 8mp 120° wide angle lens with f/2.2 really works good.third one is 2mp portrait lens for bokeh effect in photo.last but not the least is a 2mp macro lens to shoot ultimate macro shoots through your phone.And it's 13mp camera with AI mode really clicks good selfies.Next is processor,this phone comes with SD 665 processor with cloak speed of 2.01 ghz for a faster and smoother experience with adreno 610 gpu.But this phone doesn't support Pubg in Hd mode.That's a bad thing for gamers.Next is display,note 8 comes with a 2280×1080p resolution IPS display with 403ppi pixel density.And it's colour production is really good.But this phone doesn't comes with Widevine L1 certification, that's why you can't stream Netflix or Amazon Prime in full hd.But it have Widevine L3 certification.Next is battery,this phone comes with a powerful battery of 4000 mah and you will get almost one and a half day usage experience through your one time full charge.For a user like me who doesn't leave his phone for a second, it's a great thing.Interestingly this phone comes with a 18w fast charger in box.So,you can also charge your phone in no time.Next one is it's incredible sound.I just love it and i'm sure you will also love it too.It's immersive sound covers a medium sized room with high bass and treble.And there is a feature in phone called 'clear your speakers' that's also a good thing.I am telling you guys you will just love this phone.It's a killer phone from Xiomi in this price segment.If you are thinking of buying this phone,just go for it.Hope this review will helpful to you. "__aakash.
The ph is superb,bt ear piece is too low,no one can listen,if the surroundings is not quiet.
Keyboard response time is vry badI use redmi note 8 and many days i face typing speed problem ..main jab type karta hu tho ye wo word type hi nhi karta or whatsapp mai send button par 3-4bar click karu kabhi kabhi tho bhi send nhi hota.
Touch having problems and back button not working properly.
everything is perfect except if the processor will be Snapdragon 675 or above in this price..
Good.
we don't need Redmi Printed Screen Paper that nothing for use so why you putting this paper?please give normal transparent screen paper.4000mAh battery is not good for PUBG & other Games.overall Redmi Note 8 is a very good looking Mobile & Camera is Too Good.for more details please Visit "UNBOXER INDIA" YouTube Channel, Thank You.
Great camera quality and awesome product.
I gifted this phone to my brother and he is very happy with the phone. He love to click pictures and it has 48mp and clicks awesome photos. And it also supports fast charging and comes with good processor and has 4000mah which is enough for whole day use i will always prefer #redmi.

Loving the phone....Purchased with bank discount,6gb 128gb blue variant...i must say,it looks super awesome....having gorilla glass protection in front and back,it makes it even better....i would like to inform one thing that there is no 60fps video recording even after being mentioned on official website,and also there is no fingerprint gesture feature...it may come with miui 11 which is going to come within next 10 days as it is in phase 2 devices....Camera is really cool,getting some decent clicks,just install google camera and the quality is much much betterBattery backup is quite good as well,just turn off dual 4g,dont use volte if not necessary,turn of auto start for apps which u feel are not required,keep miui battery saver turned on for better backup,keep gps off when not needed,just do small adjustments and battery will surely last longerPerformance is also great considering the chipset you are getting,infact u also get 4g+ which is not even there on redmi note 7 pro and would never come also....so internet speed,call quality,signal strength...everything is impressiveI must say,in this price range,this phone totally deserves praises from all....i hope i tried to cover all points and helped people to look for this phone as a good option for them...All the best....
