        "Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8.I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point.The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:-(1) \ud83d\ude14 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) \ud83d\ude21 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) \ud83d\udca5 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) \ud83d\udc40 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) \ud83d\udcf7 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) \ud83e\udd2e Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) \ud83e\udd15 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates.(9) \ud83d\udd25 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes.\u26ab Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you.",
        "This product is very good and very good quality thank you Amazon thank you so muchI am use this device 6 day very smuthly and very fast and fast charge charging time 1 hour 45",
        "To all consumers who are looking for a decent midrange smartphone today, this Redmi Note 8 is a solid pick.Ads? You can disable it on Settings, though disabling it one by one but worth it after doing it.Chipset? It's above average since it can play graphic demand games very well. Day to day work? So dang good. Transition between apps is no slouch.Compared to same level smartphones the display looks crispy, and speakers are powerful. At last, its highly customisable system brings a great experience for hard users.Cameras? Stock app is straight garbage (except the macro mode). Just install google Camera and you're good to go. Details will be flagship like.The battery it's good as well and gaming it's a \"just good\" experience, not bad at all (smooth on high preferences, not ultra)Price? Bang of the buck for this segment!Highly recommended for people who doesn't want confusion on buying this price range...",
        "I purchased it from redmi store. Its performance is awesome.Super clarity display, good battery backup, super loud speaker with thunder voice.... Etc.... U can buy this without thinking more",

        "It took around 9 days to get the product delivered. It's a great phone. Battery backup is awesome. Fast charger is provided in the box. Front Camera isn't that great, but still, it's very good. Rear camera takes good pictures. Fingerprint is also very fast, but little bit slow as compared to my Realme 3 pro. Still fingerprint is fast enough. Also, the glass back is awesome. Overall a good phone. Got it for 8,999/-Also got Rs 100 Amazon cashback. It's a killer deal even in 9,999/-. Just go for it.",

        "I have purchased redmi note 8 at 25th October and within 8 days Dust particle accumulated in camera lensDon't buy!!!!!!!!!!",
        "I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date.Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand.So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker.Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this.This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera.The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charmGCam7+ Redmi Note 8=\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end\ud83e\udd17Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better.Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all.Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins.Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better.Extra Features:-IR blaster \u2714\ufe0fGorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant\u2714\ufe0fSelf cleaning speaker\u2714\ufe0fWireless FM\u2714\ufe0fP2i coating\u2714\ufe0fUSB C\u2714\ufe0fFast 18W charger in the box\u2714\ufe0fCons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your deviceVery very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales.Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close.If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it\u270c\ufe0fFair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit.Get this phone asap and Install GCam 7 and let this perfect combo amaze you\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25Thanks for reading this review if you find this helpful like this and have a great day.",

        "Lot of issues with the phone software. Loads of unwanted stuff on the phone. Screen is very bright in the night and even the lowest setting does not work well. Google Assistant does not work. Voice activation for Assistant does not work. Xiaomi does not have answer for it. No point getting a phone and struggling with it. Better phones available.",
        "I purchased this product during the first flash sale. I got a completely diffractive phone. When I switch on the phone I found that touch screen is not working. So I fail to move to the next pages for activating phone functions. I don't expect this from Redmi and Amazon.",

        "side & Bottom border area keyboard keys are not working properly, like p, q, capslock, backspace, '?123', navigation keys like back, home etc. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't, it's very irritating when you have to correct spelling by deleting the misspelt word due to miss of the letter. At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed------------------------------------------REPLACED------------------------------------Got it replaced with another handset, though the keys I mentioned above seem to be responding fine now, other areas are giving similar problem, like the 'abc' key which is used to switch the keyboard from letters to number and symbols. Also, after dropping down the notification shade the setting gear icon is not responding properly.  Screen touch issues lies in many places over the screen. So the hit-miss pattern is still on but on some other areas. This is very irritating. The voice leak during call still lingering over some or other calls.",
        "After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention:1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it.2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight.3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick.4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi.  I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone.To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi.Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range.",
        "The most disappointing think is that the SIM slot is put already by the company upside down and slightly bend from the top I have to bend it also on the other side to make it straight and when I put the SIM there is no chance that will keep the SIM card but it show the SIM card range so it means it's not damage just slightly bend and I don't like the redmi branding on the front I am expecting the clean look",

This is same with Redmi note 7s.Now about the camera, sound, display , charging speed, all are good.My old Realme 1 has good battery life than this.I hope you got a little idea about Redmi note 8You can buy it .

The stock cam is not that great.The build quality is good and so is the designThe display could have been better, not that great. The display on my asus zenfone maxpro m2 is better, according to meBiggest drawback is the flash sale - It's a hit or a miss. However, I got it on day 1.",
        "I was very happy that I bought it in first sale but my happiness ruined because Amazon delivered me a faulty product. Whenever I try to turn on my mobile from sleep it always take 5 to 8 seconds to just turn on the screen, no matter whether I am trying with fingerprint sensor/Double tap method or pressing right side button. I tried to replace the product but Amazon checked my phone with some terrible blancco app and said that there is no fault in my mobile. They didn't replaced it. pathetic. Don't purchase this mobile from here.",

        "This is probably the best all-rounder in sub rs 10000 (9999). I got is in 8999 with offerPros1. Very premium looking with glass design2. Display is bright enough3. A good processor ( though better one snapdragon 710 is available at same price with realme 3 pro)4. 48 mp ( really a 16mp) camera is superb5. Four camera setup gives flexibility to your photograph with wide angle and macro lens6. Night photos are also good7. 18 watt fast charg support and also inside the box availableCons.1. Glass design may get cracked when fall down from height.2. SD 710 is also available at same price range from realme3. Redmi may have used Samsung gm2 48mp sensor which is better compared to gm1.4. Though wide angle camera is good it is still an 8mp5. The Qualcomm quick charge is very slow when compared with VOOC6. It has been long days (4-5 years) redmi is using 4000mAh battery. Though it is big enough but battery capacity should be increased to 4500mAh same as its pro versionIf I find anything else I will update it.",
        "Nice",
        "I m buying redmi note 8 by Amazon it's front camera is lower level",
        "Redmi note 8 is a complete all-rounder.This review is after 15 days of usage.The pros of this phone are as follows1) PriceI got it at an effective price of Rs.8500 during the sale days. Even then @Rs.10000 it is still a very good buy.2) Built QualityThe phone is extremely sturdy, which might be very helpful for rough and tough use. And the glass back gives a very premium feel but need to be extra careful for that.Also Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection is very helpful.3) BatteryThe battery easily lasts for more than a day with mediocre usage.4) Quick chargingThe co. a fast charger in the box, it takes around 1 hour 45 min to charge from 0 to 100.5) ProcessorIt works extremely well for day to day tasks (don't know about high CPU consumption games like Pubg and all)6) Sound qualityThe Audio speaker is loud for a normal environment.7) Dedicated SD card slot8) SizeThe phone is 6.3 inch, though bigger than palm sized phone, it is always an better option than the 6.5 inch phones which have become a trend in today's market.Cons1) CameraThe quality of camera is not like 48mp. Its not that great nor that bad. It's okay okay types.2) BloatwareThere are huge no. of pre installed apps and the ads are still very much a part of OS.3) Flash SaleI think the concept of flash sales should be dropped , due to this many people could not avail the discounts during the festive sales.4) Heating IssueThe phones heats up a bit while charging but it's completely normal considering the fast charging and other factors.5) BulkyThe phones seems bulky at times. Its somewhere round 200 gmsConclusion:The best buy at @10000 at this price range and the features.Could not ask for more.",

        "I am fully satisfied with this phone, battery is good, screen quality is good especially the black, it looks like amoled display.Gg5 glass on top is so solid that even geans can't scratch the glass, it is far superior than redmi note 7. It worth the upgrade. I got a 170k score on antutu which is very high on this price segment.The cameras are the main highlight of this phone, the 48mp takes amazing pictures and videos(4k) at night, pixel binning comes very handy at night situations.The macro camera is also good, don't bother the 2mp resolution, it takes amazing pictures.The ultra wide lens is very nice, it takes pictures at 120\u00b0 angle.There is a glass covering on the fingerprint which makes it very easy to clean it.The depth sensor with the help of mi camera takes very eye catching portraits.The most amazong part is the phones comes with a 18watt charger in the box, it charges my phone from 20 to 95 percent in 1 hour.I prefer the moonlight white color of this phone, it looks so premium.",

        "Redmi note 8(4gb,64gb,Moonlight White)Pros & Cons:\" Redmi launches it's new phone in the indian market from the price 9999.I'm using this phone for last 4days and this is my review.Redmi Note 8 's most attractive thing is its look,this phone comes with a glossy glass back with white and blue shade and side edges are made of plastic but it just looks like stainless steel and it run MiUi 10 based on android 9,gives you preety cool experience,but this custom ui have so many bloatware and ads.Second thing is its camera,note 8 comes with a 48mp quad camera array.first one is a 48mp camera with pro mode and ai mode.second one is 8mp 120\u00b0 wide angle lens with f/2.2 really works good.third one is 2mp portrait lens for bokeh effect in photo.last but not the least is a 2mp macro lens to shoot ultimate macro shoots through your phone.And it's 13mp camera with AI mode really clicks good selfies.Next is processor,this phone comes with SD 665 processor with cloak speed of 2.01 ghz for a faster and smoother experience with adreno 610 gpu.But this phone doesn't support Pubg in Hd mode.That's a bad thing for gamers.Next is display,note 8 comes with a 2280\u00d71080p resolution IPS display with 403ppi pixel density.And it's colour production is really good.But this phone doesn't comes with Widevine L1 certification, that's why you can't stream Netflix or Amazon Prime in full hd.But it have Widevine L3 certification.Next is battery,this phone comes with a powerful battery of 4000 mah and you will get almost one and a half day usage experience through your one time full charge.For a user like me who doesn't leave his phone for a second, it's a great thing.Interestingly this phone comes with a 18w fast charger in box.So,you can also charge your phone in no time.Next one is it's incredible sound.I just love it and i'm sure you will also love it too.It's immersive sound covers a medium sized room with high bass and treble.And there is a feature in phone called 'clear your speakers' that's also a good thing.I am telling you guys you will just love this phone.It's a killer phone from Xiomi in this price segment.If you are thinking of buying this phone,just go for it.Hope this review will helpful to you. \"__aakash",
